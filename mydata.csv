ACE’s Low Carbon Strategy Pays Dividends
A new USDA program could soon establish the quantification and verification protocols necessary for long-awaited climate-smart farming incentives, which could begin to scale ethanol’s role in an increasingly  decarbonized transportation sector.
By Brian Jennings       | December 20, 2021

Given persistent challenges regarding the Environmental Protection Agency’s mismanagement of the RFS, ACE has been taking direction from our Board of Directors to be proactive about opportunities to expand ethanol demand through new clean fuel or low carbon policies and markets.
According to the United States Department of Agriculture, U.S. farmers currently store over 20 million metric tons of carbon per year and they can store an additional 180 million metric tons per year representing 12-14 percent of U.S. carbon emissions annually. The Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory has found that deploying specific crop rotation systems in the upper Great Plains would result in increased carbon sequestration, reducing the carbon intensity of agricultural production, and generating hundreds of dollars per acre in revenue if credited in state low carbon fuel markets.
Despite this promise, established mandatory carbon markets like the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard do not yet credit greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions achieved through carbon sequestering conservation practices like no-till, cover crops and nitrogen management undertaken in ethanol feedstock production. These regulators want better localized quantification, verification and modeling protocols in order to grant access to these low carbon markets. These same themes permeate discussions in Washington D.C. on the theory of using low carbon fuel programs to drive decarbonization goals, and in the Midwestern states when discussing the specifics that should be included in new clean fuel policies and markets.
That is why ACE partnered with South Dakota Corn, Dakota Ethanol, South Dakota State University and Cultivating Conservation to leverage $7.5 million in USDA funding to document ethanol’s net-negative carbon potential in the real world. Under this ACE-USDA program, farmers will be compensated for adopting climate-smart agricultural practices that sequester carbon, reduce GHG emissions, and improve soil health. Importantly, the partnership will quantify the resulting soil health and GHG benefits, correlate them with existing models, and develop a non-proprietary verification system to secure the first approved access to LCFS markets based on these on-farm conservation practices.
The project is leveraging USDA funds to open low carbon fuel markets for farmers and ethanol companies. In the South Dakota project area, this access could mean upwards of $10 million in additional revenue annually because of the GHG contributions from on-farm conservation practices.
The new ACE-USDA project answers the question of “how” for one ethanol facility corn draw. Beyond that, it also illuminates the path forward for the industry.
Recently, USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack announced a new Climate Smart Agriculture and Forestry Partnership Program designed to reduce barriers to climate markets such as LCFS programs and leverage USDA funds to develop new revenue streams for farmers. It is a significant opportunity to utilize USDA resources to gain broader access to existing state low carbon fuel markets. It is an even more significant opportunity to establish the quantification and verification protocols necessary to scale ethanol’s ability to power a sizable piece of a decarbonized transportation sector into the future.
I realize some people are concerned all this talk about climate change may spell trouble for liquid fuels because too many politicians lazily think electric vehicles are the only transportation-related climate solution, but ACE is confident ethanol is the best low carbon option to replace petroleum and provide meaningful GHG reductions.
That is why we have been highlighting climate-smart farming practices though this new USDA project, and we will keep taking proactive steps to ensure corn ethanol is part of the climate solution.
Our hard work is already yielding important results for farmers and ethanol producers who want to seize opportunities to increase demand based on ethanol’s low carbon value in new clean fuel markets.

Ecocide: Should Destruction of the Planet Be a Crime?
Share this article
BRUSSELS—Philippe Sands steps off his train at Brussels’ Midi station and sees a familiar face amidst a flurry of passengers. 
The British lawyer is flush with energy, despite being at the tail end of a week-long visit with clients on the island nation of Mauritius. His casual black jacket, navy blue scarf and black boots give him the appearance of a relaxed college professor. But his furrowed face and sharp gaze are those of a man who sees the world with a certain type of intensity. 
He greets his colleague, an arts executive, with an elbow bump and they hurry to grab a taxi. Sands, a dark-haired, 61-year-old with a salt and pepper beard, high forehead and gray-green eyes, has come to speak about his latest book, “The Ratline,” and to give two lectures on what he hopes will become the first international crime since 1945: ecocide. 
His lectures are part of a global campaign, led by Stop Ecocide International, to make acts of mass environmental destruction a crime within the purview of the International Criminal Court, which has a mandate to investigate and prosecute individuals who otherwise would evade accountability after committing the most serious crimes of concern to humanity at large. 
Sands is a professor of law at the University College London. He has written 18 books, is a sought after international lawyer at Matrix Chambers—and by sought after, countries seek out his counsel—and he is a frequent contributor to publications like The Financial Times, The Guardian and The New York Times. He is also the president of English PEN—a human rights organization that promotes the freedom to read and write internationally—and a member of the International Court of Arbitration for Sport, among other endeavors. That advocating for an ecocide crime is the next step in Sands’ long and capacious career says something both about who he is and about the peril of the moment we are living in.

Three days before Sands arrived in Brussels, world leaders concluded global climate change talks in Glasgow, Scotland. The results left the world doubtful that governmental negotiations alone can end the crisis. Since Glasgow, analysts have warned that the world is now on a pathway to a dangerous 2.4 degrees Celsius of warming, manifesting itself in weather extremes, biodiversity collapse, acidification of oceans and soil erosion—all affecting the health and wellbeing of humans and other species.  
In the backseat of the taxi, Sands tells the driver in fluent French to head to the Rue Duquesnoy in the heart of the city. Over a four-decade career, Sands has spent his fair share of time in the European Union’s capital city, as well as other centers of international commerce, where he regularly rubs shoulders with politicians, diplomats, journalists and, from time to time, royalty. Sands just learned that his brother-in-law is also in town for a meeting with Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the embattled former president of Brazil who has shaken off a series of corruption charges and is running against Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil’s 2022 election. His brother-in-law, Joseph Stiglitz, is a Nobel-prize winning economist, making Sands, with his laundry list of accomplishments, the lesser known spouse in the Schiffrin family. Sands’ wife, Natalia Schiffrin, is the daughter of the late, renowned publisher André Schiffrin, and a well regarded attorney and magistrate in her own right. 
As much as he is part of the establishment, the Cambridge-educated Sands has a reputation as a rebel, never missing an opportunity to criticize those same elites. He has faced off against his own government more than once and was one of the first voices to condemn the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq and the United Kingdom’s support of the war—that didn’t go over well with his then-law partner, Cherie Booth, Tony Blair’s then-spouse. “Huge row,” Sands said about it. In 2019, decrying the alleged mass murder, forced deportation and rape of Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslims by the country’s military before the International Court of Justice, he denounced the nation’s then-leader, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to her face: “We heard much from Myanmar’s Agent about the vital importance of domestic accountability, but not a word—not a word—about the women and the girls of her country, Myanmar, who have been subjected to these awful serial violations. Madam Agent, your silence said far more than your words!” And while he is a consummate supporter of the International Criminal Court, he has also been one of its biggest critics. In particular, he has decried the court’s historical focus on African defendants, saying: “Africa doesn’t have a monopoly on international crime.”
Agitating for progressive change in the law and culture has been a hallmark of his career, and now, believing the world is facing an environmental crisis of epic proportions, he has become a leading voice behind calls to put mass harm to the environment below international criminal law’s moral red line, alongside war crimes and genocide. 
Sands’ is widely seen as the ideal spokesman for the cause because of his legal bona fides, his charisma and his fire for justice. It also doesn’t hurt that Sands is an expert in the history of two of the world’s major international crimes: genocide and crimes against humanity. His 2014 book “East West Street” traces the lives of two Eastern European Jews who fought for creation of the crimes, and a third man, a Nazi bureaucrat, who presided over the murders of their families, and Sands’ own.

He also understands the political machinations of states and has seen how quickly major changes in the law can take place under the right circumstances, like the adoption of the 1987 Montreal Protocol in reaction to a growing hole in the ozone layer. “The international community moves very fast when it has to—not when it wants to—when it has to,” he said during a July interview. 
Still, looming over Sands is the question: With little time to spare, can he convince enough world leaders that perpetrators of mass environmental harm should no longer go unpunished? 
A Lecture to Trade Unionists on Ecocide
The taxi jerks to a stop outside the stately Warwick Hotel, and Sands drops his small roller bag at the front desk. He has about 30 minutes before he’s due to give his first speech on ecocide at the European Trade Union Confederation. He decides to walk the mile or so there under a gray November sky. Anytime he has the chance to walk, he takes it. The movement helps to clear his mind and organize his thoughts. Back in London, he walks on the heath near his home and often coaxes colleagues and friends into joining him. His best friend and former colleague, James Cameron, who is also a distinguished environmental lawyer, said that it can be hard to get a word in edgewise on those walks. “He has to fight really hard to be quiet,” Cameron said, laughing.
Toting a black messenger bag stuffed with a laptop, iPad and papers, Sands walks for about 30 minutes to a building in the quiet business district. His talk is scheduled for a conference room on the ground floor with a projection screen, a table of catered salads, sandwiches, pastries and four tables surrounded by red office chairs. 
He grabs a quinoa salad—“I’m trying to eat more vegetarian meals,” he says—and takes his place in front of the screen. Covid numbers in the region have been surging and his audience will be mostly virtual. He removes his watch and lays it next to a thin packet of talking points, which he rarely checks. His goal is not so much to preach about the state of the world’s ecosystems but rather to educate his audience about how an ecocide crime would fit into modern international criminal law and function in reality.
“I want to give you a little bit of context and background so you can situate this in its broader framework,” he says. “As of 1945, there have been four international crimes, the oldest one is war crimes, a 19th century invention, and then three invented in 1945 in the context of the creation of the international military tribunal at Nuremberg: crimes against humanity, the destruction of individuals; genocide, the destruction of groups; and the crime of aggression, the waging of illegal war.” 
“All of these existing international crimes, and there have been no new ones for 75 years, focus on the protection of the human being, for obvious and very good reasons. None of the international crimes as such focus on the environment, because of course in 1945 the environment wasn’t part of the international legal order or part of political consciousness.” 
His virtual audience is composed of labor and workers’ rights representatives, one of many groups Stop Ecocide International is looking to for political support. Though Sands prefers to talk in person—he likes to feel what the audience is feeling and adjust his direction and tone accordingly—he still speaks with a degree of sweep and verve characteristic of a litigator. Those familiar with his legal career say that his oral arguments transform dry legalese into compelling stories that unspool with a dramatic flair. “He has tremendous presentation skills,” said Paul C. Saunders, an American lawyer and former opponent of Sands in a high-stakes dispute between Suriname and Guyana. “He’s like a three dimensional chess player, always thinking a few different steps ahead in three different directions and seeing the consequences of things.”
Sands tells the audience that the time has come for the law to evolve beyond the ideas set forth in 1945. “We must sever the connection between international criminal law and an anthropocentric approach,” he says, referencing the work of American legal scholar Christopher Stone, whose 1972 law review article, “Should Trees Have Standing,” has long been a touchstone for Sands. “Protection of the environment is an end in and of itself.”
A Young Legal Star, From Cambridge to the Rio Summit 
The son of a dentist and an antique bookstore manager in comfortable North London, Sands began his career as a legal research assistant of Eli Lauterpacht at Cambridge University. He had no particular desire to pursue environmental law. But that all changed in April 1986 when a nuclear power plant melted down in the Soviet Union. 
Lauterpacht encouraged him to write about the legal obligations resulting from radioactive waste that was not respecting international borders. Sands’ work on Chernobyl turned into his first book, which led to speaking invitations. Two leading American environmental lawyers, Wendy Dinner and Durwood Zaelke, were in the audience at one of Sands’ lectures in Washington, D.C. They tracked down Sands and Cameron, his colleague, at their hotel. Fueled by youthful optimism and drinks at the Tabard Inn bar, the foursome launched the Center For International Environmental Law with the aim of pushing the equitable development of international environmental law. 
Their timing and instincts couldn’t have been better. The world was gearing up for the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit to hash out how to tackle a panoply of growing environmental problems from biodiversity loss to climate change. Sands and his colleagues recognized the injustice at the heart of those issues: industrialized countries amassed their wealth in part through unrestrained pollution into the global commons while small nations that contributed little to the problems faced the worst effects. The group, acting pro bono with the backing of the Ford Foundation, approached small low lying island nations and convinced them to band together, using CIEL as their legal representation. 
In 1990, the same year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its first assessment, Sands, using a bulky compaq computer, typed out the founding agreement of the Alliance of Small Island States, known as AOSIS, with Cameron looking over his shoulder. The coalition of vulnerable countries has since become known as the conscience of climate change negotiations for their role in consistently pushing for strong emission reductions and equitable financing for the most affected nations. 
By 1991, Sands and Cameron had put together their own draft climate change treaty, chock full of new and progressive ideas, including an insurance mechanism to help vulnerable countries cope with the effects of climate change. They presented the document through the island nation of Vanuatu in February 1991 at the first of six intergovernmental meetings leading up to the Rio conference. The move shocked the representatives of powerful countries, who bristled at the ballsy move. Dan Esty, who attended the summit on behalf of the United States and is now a Yale law professor, said the draft treaty instantly elevated the standing of small island countries: “They demonstrated the truth of an idea—that if you come to a conversation, not because you bring big power or money, but bring a big idea with an important moral foundation, you can get people to pay attention.” 
Still, powerful fossil fuel lobbyists and a group of oil producing nations chipped away at the draft. Sands worried about the direction of the talks, but ultimately decided that an imperfect agreement was better than no agreement. He has remained critical of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change’s political process and its ability to meaningfully curb dangerous emissions. “We’ve squandered the 30 intervening years and wasted time,” he said in July. 
Following the Rio conference, Sands veered away from his work on climate change, taking the same audacious energy to his own legal practice before international courts. Soon, he and his mentors Tulumi Neroni Slade, then the Samoan Ambassador to the United Nations, and James Crawford, then a law professor at Cambridge, would argue a case that now forms the core of international environmental law. 
In the mid ‘90s, France resumed testing nuclear weapons in the South Pacific, leaving widespread radioactive waste in the atmosphere and ocean. Lacking the political and military power to stop the hazardous tests, the affected countries looked to the rule of law for help. They backed a U.N. resolution asking the International Court of Justice to issue an advisory opinion on the legality of the use of nuclear weapons. 
Representing the Solomon Islands, Sands and his colleagues developed a series of arguments aimed at pushing the World Court to embrace a more pro-environmental perspective. Even if the decision fell short on the illegality of nuclear weapon use, there was an opportunity for the U.N. tribunal to affirm the environment’s place in general international law. Major nuclear powers like France, the United States and the United Kingdom balked at the idea, arguing that environmental protection had no place in general international law. 
Months went by as the parties waited on a ruling. When the day came to hear the opinion read aloud in open court, Sands felt as he always does on the cusp of a decision: anxious and prepared for the worst. But by paragraph 29 of the decision, the most authoritative international tribunal made clear: environmental protection is a concern of international law. “‘The environment is not an abstraction but represents the living space, the quality of life and the very health of human beings, including generations unborn,” the court ruled.
Soon, the International Court of Justice received an increase of cases with environmental issues, building up a body of law that Sands would later draw from in his work on ecocide.
“It was revolutionary,” Sands said in July.  “A little group of countries had basically changed the world.”

In Brussels, the Ecocide Lecture: ‘You Can’t Put a Corporation in Prison’
Shortly after Sands begins his lecture in Brussels on ecocide at the European Trade Union Confederation, a tall, slender man with dark curly hair walks into the room. Samuel Cogolati, 32, is a Belgian lawmaker who has advocated for a domestic and international ecocide crime for years. Wearing a blue suit and white sneakers, Cogolati apologizes for being late and tells the virtual attendees that two years ago even progressive academics and thinkers had laughed at him for pushing for an ecocide crime. The idea, they told him, was too vague to be taken seriously. Their views changed in June, Cogolati explains, when a drafting panel co-chaired by Sands released its proposed definition for the crime, giving the movement legal legitimacy: ecocide is unlawful or wanton acts committed with knowledge that there is a substantial likelihood of severe and either widespread or long-term damage to the environment being caused by those acts.
As Cogolati speaks, Sands strokes his beard with his right hand and jots down notes whenever he hears a point he wants to rebut or remember. He feels most himself when he is batting around ideas with others. “Philippe likes to work things out by disagreement,” Cameron said, adding that Sands’ tendency to challenge ideas can agitate certain sensibilities. When Cogolati makes a remark suggesting the crime of ecocide should apply to corporate entities along with individuals, Sands’ starts fidgeting with his pen until he has an opening to jump in. “Could I just play devil’s advocate for one last second,” he says, holding up his left hand. “Is there not a risk that by putting corporations into that definition, that prosecutors will say it’s less sensitive if we go against the corporation, and we will avoid going against the individual.” 
He continues: “And that undermines the deterrent effect because at the end of the day…you can’t put a corporation in prison.” Sands jabs his left pointer finger in the air as he emphasizes each word: “And what concentrates the mind of the chief executive is that she or he or they will personally be subject to criminal responsibility.” 
Sands’ embrace of what at times can be difficult conversations stems from his fundamental sense of curiosity, according to Farhana Yamin, a prominent environmental lawyer and one of Sands’ longstanding friends. When he’s being interviewed, he refuses to receive the interview questions ahead of time—“I prefer spontaneity and it’s a better experience for the audience.” His contrarian tendencies are also rooted in one of his core beliefs: reasonable people can differ on many things. But after a dustup, his thoughts inevitably turn on himself. Was he polite enough, did he talk too much, and was he effective? 
But at this moment, he is in the flow. His perfect Queen’s English unfurls with a distinct clarity as he explains how environmental concerns began to creep into the global legal order beginning in the 1970s thanks in large measure to the Vietnam War and the United States’ widespread and long term use of highly toxic defoliants. Then, in the lead up to the 1998 conference in Rome that established the International Criminal Court, there was more discussion about a fifth crime of ecocide, but a number of countries thought the time wasn’t right. 
He’s quick to note that it was the work of advocates, specifically Jojo Mehta and the late Polly Higgins, co-founders of Stop Ecocide International, who pushed the idea of an ecocide crime into the mainstream. It was Mehta, carrying on Higgins’ decade-long campaign, who invited Sands in the fall of 2020 to co-chair the panel charged with legally defining the crime. The group, which differed ideologically, professionally and geographically, something Sands emphasizes, met once a month on Zoom for three hours at a time and more often in smaller working groups. Sands and his counterpart, Dior Fall Sow, a Senegalese jurist, were adamant that the group reach a consensus on the definition and that the final product be something that governments would embrace. 
The approach is reflective of Sands’ style—pragmatic, thoughtful and deliberate. The panel could have overreached, putting out an aggressive definition knowing that governments would  inevitably water it down. But, Sands isn’t interested in the esoteric. He wants to build things and is interested in real change. 
He tells the audience that he doesn’t like to give specific examples of ecocide—his position is that it is for prosecutors and judges to decide. Giving examples, he explains, instantly creates enemies, something the campaign can’t afford. And he’s very careful not to cast ecocide as a means to subvert the ongoing U.N. political negotiations on climate change: “As soon as states think ecocide is a backdoor to address climate change,” he said, “it’s dead.” 
In the Late 1990s, a Preamble for the International Criminal Court
As Sands was pivoting his professional focus from climate change to international courts and tribunals in the 1990s, nations that had declared “never again” in the wake of the Holocaust found themselves asking how such horrors could be repeating. 
International criminal law underwent a second growth spurt as ad hoc tribunals were set up to hold accountable perpetrators of atrocities in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, and calls for a permanent international criminal court grew louder. In 1998, the world’s nations gathered in Rome to hash out a treaty, what would become the Rome Statute, that established the permanent International Criminal Court. 
A coalition of small island states in the Pacific asked Sands and his colleague, Andrew Clapham, to represent them at the conference. The two men were tasked with drafting the treaty’s 300-word preamble, within which they ambitiously included 20 words that would come to mark a milestone toward ending impunity for the powerful: Recalling that it is the duty of every State to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for international crimes.
The words codified the idea of universal jurisdiction, which allows national governments to investigate and prosecute international crimes, even if committed outside the territory of that country. But Sands and Clapham didn’t just write that universal jurisdiction is allowable. Using the word “duty,” they set forth the idea that governments must enforce international criminal law. 
Three months later, a Spanish judge issued an arrest warrant for the former Chilean president Augusto Pinochet, 82 at the time, on grounds that the dictator was responsible for torture, mass murder and other grave human rights abuses during his reign from 1973 to 1990. Pinochet, who was in London for medical treatment, was arrested by British authorities, putting the ideal of universal jurisdiction to the test. 
The legal team representing Pinochet had asked Sands to join them in arguing that their client, as a former head of state, was immune from prosecution. Sands declined at the behest of his wife, one of only two times in his career when he turned down a case (the other time was in 2002 when Saddam Hussein sought out his counsel over whether, should the United States invade Iraq, the country could ensnare the American military by ratifying the Rome Statute and joining the International Criminal Court). 
Having rebuffed Pinochet, Sands went to work for Human Rights Watch on the other side, arguing in favor of the application of universal jurisdiction and against immunity for the former head of state. The prohibition on torture and other heinous crimes, they argued, are universal values that transcend national borders and apply even to the world’s most powerful individuals.

By the time the case had reached Britain’s House of Lords, the world was watching, and Sands had a front row seat. He recalled the moment like a sporting match. Two Law Lords had voted against Pinochet and two had voted in his favor. It all came down to the fifth Law Lord. There was absolute silence as he spoke, “no immunity.” Audible gasps flooded the chamber. 
“You could feel the axis of law shift,” Sands said. 
Ultimately, Pinochet was never extradited to Spain for trial. The United Kingdom’s then-home secretary allowed the former dictator to return to Chile based on his failing medical condition. But the case set an important precedent solidifying the principle of universal jurisdiction and denying former political leaders immunity for international crimes. 
“My view of international law is one step forward, one step sideways. A step back, two steps forward, a step sideways. The arc of history is long and irregular,” Sands said in July. 
‘It’s Not If It Happens, But When’
Having finished his first ecocide talk of the evening, Sands and Cogolati walk five minutes to where Sands will deliver his next lecture, which was organized by one of his former students at the Université Saint-Louis. On the way, they trade gossip about Belgian and international politics. Sands tells Cogolati about an invitation he received from the German Ambassador in Brussels to brief an international coalition of diplomats about ecocide. Political support is building. “It’s not if it happens, but when,” Sands says, holding up his right index finger.
The men arrive at the university and are immediately greeted by a group of five people that includes Françoise Tulkens, the former Vice-President of the European Court of Human Rights. From 2016 to 2017, Tulkens, who will be speaking alongside Sands, chaired the “Monsanto Tribunal,” which delivered a non-binding legal opinion on the company’s practices and ruled that ecocide should be an international crime. 
The group makes their way to the lecture hall, which is about half full with students and peppered with about 10 middle aged men in suits, some of whom are Belgium policymakers. The country’s legislature is on the cusp of voting on domestic ecocide legislation and deciding whether to back the international effort. 
Sands is aware that one man is particularly important: he is drafting a legislative report on the viability of an ecocide law. Though a small country, Belgium’s support could act as a catalyst for other governments to quickly get on board, and, as home to the headquarters of the European Union and NATO, it would be a powerful bellwether. Conscious of this, Sands knows he must deliver.
Sands’ is given a generous introduction, though most people in the room already know who he is. He launches into what he calls his ecocide stump speech in French from a seat on a raised dais. Behind him is a large bright projection screen with the word ecocide written in cursive and the crime’s French definition below it. 
If he feels any pressure it doesn’t show. He makes jokes and the audience laughs. The suits in the audience take notes and intermittently students lean forward, smile and nod their heads in agreement. Sands can feel their energy and knows he’s connecting with them.
At one point, Sands shares that his work on the campaign has made him question his own professional choices. He has represented a number of countries in boundary disputes that inevitably are about access to, and exploitation of, natural resources. 
During the Q&A portion of the lecture, Sands is asked about whether the definition sets too high of a threshold for an act to qualify as ecocide. He explains that international criminal law is only concerned with the most egregious crimes. And, practically speaking, for the definition to have political support, it could not be used as a form of neocolonialism that prevents the global south from developing. To that end, the definition includes a balancing test between social and economic benefit, on one side, and environmental harms, on the other.
When the lecture wraps up, the room gives him an extended round of applause. The man he has been watching moves slowly to the dias where Sands is sitting and signals that he wants Sands to come closer. The man whispers something in his ear. 
In two weeks, Belgium’s lawmakers would pass a resolution supporting both domestic and international ecocide legislation.

Picking Up the Pen, Taking on Bush and Rumsfeld 
Sands found himself literally at ground zero in the U.S. war on terror as a global professor at New York University Law School on Sept. 11, 2001. In 2002, he began working on a case in which he helped secure the release of 24-year-old British National, Feroz Abbasi, who had been wrongfully detained at Guantánamo Bay without evidence. The case gave the then 42-year old lawyer a close look at how the U.S. government was cutting legal and ethical corners, if not outright breaking them.
When U.S. troops invaded Iraq in March 2003, Sands was outraged and deeply concerned about what he saw as a “manifest violation of international law.” He wanted to understand, as he put it: “How…a country as profoundly attached to the rule of law and principles of constitutionality as the United States could have so little regard for international law?” 
In 2005, he answered that question in his first non-academic book, “Lawless World,” a scathing critique of America’s evolving engagement, for better or worse, depending on the perspective, with international rules like the Geneva Conventions, the U.N.’s restrictions on the use of force, the Kyoto Protocol and the International Criminal Court’s Rome Statute, which Bill Clinton signed in 2000 and George W. Bush “unsigned” in 2002. Later that year, Bush signed what is known as the “Hague Invasion” law, giving the president authority to use force should Americans be detained at the court.

One chapter in the book scrutinizes how the first Bush administration justified the use of what is widely believed to be torture, in the name of fighting terrorism. But, Sands still had a burning desire to know how lawyers like him could so easily subvert the rule of law they swore an oath to uphold. He wanted to go further. So he started cold-calling administration lawyers and pouring over official documents like Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld’s notorious Action Memo, which aimed to legitimize extreme interrogation measures like waterboarding, sleep deprivation and mental and physical torment.
His research produced the 2008 book “Torture Team,” a searing analysis of the role top American officials played in systematizing torture. In it, he disproved the administration’s narrative that torture had come from the bottom up, as opposed to a top-down administration policy.
The acclaim for Sands’ books began to raise his profile outside of the international legal establishment and cement his place as a storyteller who could weave complicated topics into page-turning narratives. Three years after “Torture Team” was published, he received an invitation that, unbeknowst to him at the time, would again change the trajectory of his career. 
Growing up, Sands had a close relationship with his maternal grandfather, Leon Buchholz. But his grandfather never spoke about his life before 1945, and Sands and his brother Marc knew not to ask any questions. So when the University of Lviv in Ukraine invited Sands to give a lecture on crimes against humanity and genocide in 2010, he accepted knowing that Buchholz was born in the city, then known as Lemberg. 
In Lviv, he embarked on a journey of both familial and self-discovery. His research also led him to find that the two men responsible for bringing the concepts of crimes against humanity and genocide into the conscience of the world, Hersch Lauterpacht and Raphael Lemkin, respectively, were born around the same time as Buchholz and in the same region of Eastern Europe. They also attended the university where Sands was invited to speak. (In an almost unbelievable twist of fate, Lauterpacht’s son, Eli, had been his mentor at Cambridge Law). 
Sands tells the story of those three men in his accalimed 2016 book “East West Street,” including how Lauterpacht and Lemkin fought against all odds, and in two very different ways, to bring to life the idea that sovereignty can no longer be a shield that prevents mass murderers from accountability. Because of their work, crimes against humanity and genocide were written into the fabric of the Nuremberg tribunal and now form the foundation of modern international criminal law. 
The book also tells the story of a fourth man, Hans Frank, who as Hitler’s personal lawyer and then governor-general of Nazi-occupied Poland, bore responsibility for the extermiation of the families of Lauterpacht, Lemkin and Buchholz. At Nuremberg, Frank was charged with crimes against humanity and genocide. He was convicted and hanged in October 1946. 
For Sands, Latuerpacht and Lemkin provide examples of human resilience in the face of catastrophe: “They didn’t curl up in a corner and weep when faced with a crisis,” he said in July. “They used the power of their ideas to change the world.” 
On the Train to Amsterdam 
When he settled into his seat on the 2:22 p.m. Eurostar train from Brussels to Amsterdam the day after his two whirlwind ecocide lectures, Sands welcomed the opportunity to relax. His destination that evening was a 17th century Mennonite church in the center of town where he was to deliver a talk about “The Ratline.” 
But I’d been asking him questions about his legal career for two days running, and he was still thinking about a woman—a client—named Marie Liseby Elysé. She was 20 years old in 1973 when the colonial British government forcibly removed her entire community, about 2,000 people, many of whom were former slaves, from their homes in the Chagos Islands. The forced relocation was, in part, to make way for the U.S. military base Diego Garcia. In 2018, Elysé recounted the experience of being forced onto a ship and treated like “animals and slaves.” She was four months pregnant at the time and miscarried after arriving in Mauritius. 
He showed me photographs from his recent Mauritius trip, one of which is Elysé sitting on a couch in her living room. She’s smiling warmly at Sands who is taking the photograph.
From 2018 to 2019, Sands represented Mauritius before the International Court of Justice. He won a favorable advisory opinion for the Indian Ocean island nation, with the court ruling that during the decolonization process, the United Kingdom had wrongfully separated the Chagos Islands from Mauritius and that London had to end its control over the islands as soon as possible. The U.N. General Assembly later affirmed the court’s opinion, but the United Kingdom has refused to comply with the ruling.
He opens his silver laptop and pulls up a map of the Chagos Islands as the Dutch countryside rolls by his left side. When he talks about the case, which he calls one of the most important of his career, his nose wrinkles and the volume of his voice ticks up, tinged with an edge of disgust. “It is a disgrace that my country has treated them as they have,” he says. “I’m ashamed of it.” 
For him, the Chagos case is emblematic of an international legal system that is still infused with vestiges of colonialism. It proves, he says, that powerful nations continue to pursue their narrow self interests and, when it suits them, ignore the legal order they purport to uphold. He wrote about the case in an April opinion piece in the New York Times , highlighting the U.S. and U.K. governments’ intransigence over Chagos and arguing that an a la carte approach to legal rules emboldens authoritarian nations like China and Russia. ”…anyone who wants to weaponize the rule of law first needs to have their own house in order,” he wrote. In August 2022, he is releasing a short book about the case called “The Last Colony.”

Sands spends the rest of the train ride answering emails by jabbing his keyboard with his right index finger. With about 20 minutes left in the journey, he puts on a pair of Bose over the ear headphones, closes his eyes and listens to Leonard Cohen’s 2009 Live in London show. 
It’s rare that he has time alone. Most people in his orbit clamor for a piece of his time and attention, and he is fairly generous with both. He makes it a point to respond to each email he receives about his books. At dinners, he circles around the table to connect with each person. And he regrets that he has to decline most of the speaking invitations he receives—about 10 per week.
When he arrives in Amsterdam, he makes a quick stop at his hotel, changing from lawyerly slacks to jeans. Tonight he is appearing as Sands, the author.
‘Who Are We?’
It’s 8 p.m. when he arrives at the Doopsgezinde Singelkerk church, situated alongside one of Amsterdam’s iconic canals. Outside, the night had turned cold giving the air inside the spacious hall a chill. About half the guests, socially distanced around the room in small groups, keep their jackets on. When Sands appears, some of them crane their necks and point in his direction. The moderator and Sands take their place at the center of the hall, which has a high ceiling and two floors of galleries along three of the four walls. The space, with two softly lit chandeliers, has an intimate feel to it. 
Sands takes the podium and begins telling the audience about how the three part series of “East West Street” (2016), “The Ratline” (2021), and the yet-to-be-named third book (about Pinochet in London due out in 2024) came into being. “It deals with issues of identity: who are we?” he explains. “And, in particular, the catalyst was questions that I had about my own identity.” By learning more about his grandfather and family, he said, he would come to know more about himself. 
His work on “East West Street” set off a cascading series of events that led him to befriend Horst Wächter, one of the six children of the lawyer and Nazi governor of Galicia, Otto Wächter. Through their on-again, off-again friendship, Sands gained access to thousands of Wächter family documents and photographs, now housed in the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. 
His forensic examination of those records, coupled with interviews and old fashioned detective work, resulted in “The Ratline,” which follows the life, and mysterious death, of Otto. The book reveals how Otto, with the unflinching support of his wife, Charlotte, rose through Nazi ranks, oversaw the deaths of over 130,000 men, women and children, including Sands’ relatives. Otto, an indicted war criminal, evaded justice and escaped to Rome after the war with the help of the Vatican—and, Sands came to discover, with the knowledge of the U.S. government.  
Central to the Wächter family’s story is the same question Sands has wrestled with throughout his career: How is it that highly intelligent and seemingly decent people can become involved in horrible things? 
“I don’t have an answer to that question,” he tells the audience. “But I have a sense of the road that allows that to happen and it begins with the crossing of the line…the skies never fall when you cross these little lines and once you’ve crossed the little lines, you can cross a slightly bigger line.” He jabs his right index finger in the air as he speaks. 
To illustrate his point, he draws a detailed picture in the minds of his audience of the decisions Otto made leading up to a consequential moment between him and his wife Charlotte on March 15, 1938. The couple was at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, where they stood next to Adolf Hitler greeting a crowd. Afterwards, the couple walked to the bottom of a marble staircase to discuss their future. In that moment, they decided Otto would accept an official position in the Nazi government, knowing fully what that choice would mean. 
“Seventy-five years later, that family is still convulsed by that single decision,” Sands said. “The legacy goes on and on.” 
‘We Have to Seize the Moment Now’
Sands lingers after the event to talk with fans until staff tell him they are turning the lights out. He walks out of the tall black doors of the Doopsgezinde Singelkerk, which means he’s completed his 10-day whirlwind trip and can relax for the moment. When he arrives back at the hotel, we sit down in the lobby to have one last conversation about ecocide. 
Cementing new values into law is painstaking business. Raphael Lemkin’s quest to criminalize genocide lasted over a decade. The relentless campaigning and ridicule for pushing a revolutionary idea took a toll on his health and livelihood. He died in 1959, broke and still trying to convince the world’s most powerful country to ratify the 1948 genocide convention. The United States finally did so in 1988. Another 10 years passed before the world saw the first conviction for a genocide crime.
Sands knows this and could easily divert his attention to more lucrative endeavors, but he chooses to devote a portion of his time, pro bono, to promoting the campaign. When asked why he does it, Sands’ response is straight forward: his three children. In 2019, while trekking across the Alps with his youngest daughter, Sands saw firsthand the lifeless plots of land where glaciers had once stood. The experience reified the idea of environmental destruction, and what it will mean for his children and future generations absent a change in course. “My generation have fucked it up,” he said. “We really have.”

His own evolution on the idea of an ecocide crime has been gradual. It’s not that he was opposed to the idea, but his innate conservatism as a legal tactician made him wonder whether the timing was right. The International Criminal Court has for years wrestled with shortcomings, having too much on its plate to effectively execute its mandate. Adding a fifth cime on top of that, Sands had thought, was a real concern. But today, he feels that worry cannot override what he calls pressing and vital threats to the environment. “If that argument had been used in 1945, that the time wasn’t right, the world would be in a much darker place,” he said. “We have to seize the moment now.” 
When speaking about ecocide, one of the questions Sands is often asked is some variation of: “Having a crime of genocide hasn’t stopped genocide from happening, so what good would an ecocide crime do?” The question is one he takes to heart and he’s quick to admit that he is not “starry-eyed” about the law and its ability to stop horrific things from happening. But, he argues, law does change consciousness. 
“Our values change over time. What is acceptable behavior, at one moment in our existence becomes unacceptable, sometimes in a very short period of time,” he said. “By changing the law, you are sending a signal: this is a value that we are cognizant of and that we want to protect.”
He sees the addition of ecocide in the rarified company of the four other international crimes as a signal that the world’s values are on the cusp of transforming.
“It is about the wellbeing of the planet. We have to break this umbilical cord where we just assume it has to be about the wellbeing of humans,” he said. “Putting the human at the center of everything has got us into a terrible mess.”
He pauses, then adds: “You have to ask people, ‘do you want to be one of the naysayers like in 1945? Is that how you want to be remembered? This is a moment and you want to be on the right side of history.”

In a memo sent to all 32 teams and signed by commissioner Gary Bettman, there are six areas of.",3 days ago,"Ice Hockey
Similar to the NBA and NFL, the NHL is dealing with a COVID-19 outbreak of its own as the omicron variant begins to take a larger hold.
As of Dec. 18, more than 60 players are in the league's COVID protocols and five teams — the Bruins, Predators, Flames, Panthers and Avalanche — are on pause through the league's upcoming holiday break, which will end Dec. 26.
According to ESPN , the league is only considering a full shutdown as ""a last resort,"" though ""things are looking pretty grim,"" reporter Emily Kaplan said on Twitter.
From @SportsCenter tonight... here's the latest on where things stand in the NHL after a hectic day.
The NHL is hoping it can avoid a full-on pause & is taking things on a case-by-case basis. But things are looking grim.....for Olympic participation, too. pic.twitter.com/QpQPf0py07
— Emily Kaplan (@emilymkaplan) December 17, 2021
The league implemented the new protocols after what transpired during the past week.
Sporting News has everything you need to know about what's going on in the NHL and how the league is handling this outbreak.
What is in the NHL's new COVID-19 protocols?
In a memo sent to all 32 teams and signed by commissioner Gary Bettman, there are six areas of emphasis in the new protocols, with the bulk of them involving prevention and testing.
Notably, the protocols apply to both vaccinated and unvaccinated players.
As to prevention, these are some of the measures the league is recommending:
Wearing masks at all times inside Club facilities and during travel, including when on buses, planes, and at the hotel (unless exercising, participating in a game, or eating or drinking)
Virtual meetings, or only brief in-person meetings in large well-ventilated spaces
It is strongly recommended that you wear masks when in public indoor places in your community.
It is strongly recommended that you wear a N95, KN95 or a surgical mask, not a cloth mask.
Physical distancing for meals (at least one empty chair) in both at the Club’s home market and on the road
As for testing, the league has implemented or suggested the following:
Daily COVID-19 molecular testing (preferably, molecular point-of-care) for all members of the Club Traveling Party for the duration of the period during which these Enhanced Measures are in place
Additional pre-game testing may be implemented, on a case-by-case basis, when a COVID outbreak occurs within a team, after consultation with the NHL and NHLPA
Consistent with the 2021-22 COVID-19 Protocol, symptomatic individuals shall be monitored with daily molecular testing until all symptoms resolve (to the satisfaction of the Club Physician)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no team testing of Players on their days off or of Players during the 90-day “testing holiday” following a confirmed positive diagnosis
The full list of new protocols can be found here . These new protocols are in place until at least Jan. 7, at which point the NHL and NHLPA medical experts will reexamine them.
Could the NHL season be paused?
Multiple media outlets are of the opinion that a leaguewide pause is unlikely even with the high number of postponements through the holiday break.
The Athletic's Sean Gentille wrote that a full shutdown would be ""a Hail Mary attempt.""
""I also don’t think the NHL wants to be 'first' here; if the NBA or NFL took leaguewide measures, that'd take hockey off the hook,"" he wrote .
ESPN's Emily Kaplan said the league is in ""triage mode"" and is ""looking to avoid a full-on shutdown at all costs.""
The league did fully pause the latter part of last season, from March 12 until play resumed Aug. 1 with a new format.
Will the protocols end the NHL's participation in the Olympics?
The NHL is planning on sending representatives to Beijing in February, but as commissioner Gary Bettman has said , that is contingent upon there not being a material disruption to the season. He has not specified what is meant by ""material disruption.""
Kaplan reported the league has until Jan. 10 to pull out of the Olympics without financial penalty. With the new protocols running until Jan. 7, that doesn't give the league much time to assess the situation and then act.
WORLD JUNIORS ROSTERS: USA | Canada
""We are nearing that cliff, if we haven't reached that cliff already,"" Kaplan said.
In her estimation, it's becoming more and more unlikely that NHL players will take the ice in Beijing given the trends.
According to  The Boston Globe , the decision not to participate would ultimately be the players'. If they opt not to go, it's likely that there will be a repeat of the 2018 Winter Olympics in terms of who plays for Team USA. That year, a collection of minor league players, players playing in Europe, U.S. collegians and free agents represented the country in Pyeongchang, South Korea, after the NHL prohibited its players from competing in the Olympics.

Kevin Prevo, who owns a farm in southern Iowa, has eliminated the use of synthetic fertilizer, one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture. That change is expected to generate several hundred carbon credits for the farm.Credit...Rachel Mummey for The New York Times
By Elizabeth G. Dunn
Nov. 23, 2021
This article is part of our latest DealBook special report on the trends that will shape the coming decades.
Eight years ago, Kevin Prevo started making changes to the land in southern Iowa that his family has farmed for five generations. Mr. Prevo stopped tilling the fields between crop cycles and started planting cover crops he does not harvest — a mix including rye, turnips, radishes and sunflowers — between rotations of his cash crops, corn, soybeans and rye.
The changes were intended to help the soil hold additional water and to prevent erosion, leading to more abundant yields, but have the added benefit of drawing more carbon dioxide into the ground and keeping it there.
Then, in 2019, Mr. Prevo met a representative from Indigo, a Boston-based agricultural technology start-up that pays growers for carbon credits that result from implementing climate-friendly practices like the ones already in use on his 1,400-acre farm. The Prevos rely mostly on manure from the hogs they raise to fertilize their fields; last year, with guidance from Indigo, they stretched it further, enabling them to eliminate the use of synthetic fertilizer, one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture.
That change is expected to generate several hundred carbon credits for the farm, which Indigo has contracted to sell for $27 a piece to buyers, such as JPMorgan Chase, Shopify and North Face that are looking to counteract their greenhouse gas emissions.
“It’s showing a lot of promise in terms of keeping yields the way they were and saving us on nitrogen costs,” said Mr. Prevo of the farm’s new fertilizer regimen. “We’ve always thought about cutting back, but this pushed us in the right direction.”
Indigo is one of at least a dozen entities at work on systems to pay farmers for reducing the use of carbon-intensive nitrogen fertilizer, planting cover crops to draw carbon dioxide into the soil and avoiding the tilling that releases it back into the atmosphere. Using a mix of on-the-ground soil sampling and predictive modeling, Indigo says it can determine how much additional carbon a farm has sequestered, or abated, by changing its practices. Each metric ton of carbon removed from the atmosphere, or avoided, generates one carbon credit.
Carbon offsets have been around for more than three decades, but demand for them has grown in recent years as companies faced increasing pressure to demonstrate a commitment to climate action.

According to the conservation nonprofit Forest Trends, in 2016, less than $200 million was invested globally in voluntary carbon offset purchases, which typically finance projects such as planting or protecting forests, capturing methane from landfills and mineralizing carbon; this year, for the first time, the figure is expected to top $1 billion.
Farmland is a new entrant in the offset conversation, but it has quickly piqued the interest of corporate buyers, especially those with agricultural products in their supply chains.
“It tells a great story, if you can tell Americans buying a product that their dollars are going to an American program that benefits farmers,” said Chris Harbourt, the global head of carbon for Indigo.
Global cropland has the potential to sequester as much as 570 million metric tons of carbon per year, according to one estimate , and experts say enlisting it to store greenhouse gas emissions will be essential to heading off the worst effects of climate change. But the same experts caution that substantial challenges — some that apply to any nature-based carbon offset, some of which are specific to farmland — must be met before compensating farmers for carbon capture becomes a robust market.
One fundamental concern is the accuracy of today’s estimates for soil-based carbon removals. Unlike with forestry projects, where the physical chemistry of carbon storage is better understood and predictive models have benefited from years of real-world data, how carbon accumulates in soil is still something of a black box. It can vary substantially based on composition, geography and depth, and there’s a relative scarcity of historical sampling data.

Here's What You Need To Remember: The better approach is to break down climate and environmental challenges into important, meaningful and manageable issues. Engage them all on their own terms
This blue dot in space is the only planet we have. We must take care of it. Like any other great challenge, this demands a seriousness of effort paired with the honesty and courage to insist on practical, realistic, efficacious policies.
The planet doesn’t know we have national borders. We do. It’s a reality that can’t be ignored and won’t change. The idea of erasing the freedoms of peoples and the sovereignty of nations to address environmental issues is unrealistic and unnecessary. Nations will cooperate and compete, just like in any other matter of international affairs.
Rather than thinking about environmental issues as a global crusade or an existential crisis that trumps every concern and national interest, climate and related challenges can be dealt with most effectively by treating it like the foreign policy problem it is. For the United States to truly lead on environmental issues, Washington must have the resolve to deliver real outcomes—solutions that come from realistic foreign policies, sound economic decisions, and unshakeable respect for human freedom.
Climate change is happening. Human activity may well play a role. There are other arguably more pressing environmental issues as well. Air pollution, particularly in developing countries, is hazardous to human health. A scarcity of fresh water affects every continent. Where property rights are not clearly defined and protected, excessive exploitation of fisheries and other natural resources remains a problem in many regions around the world. Millions of tons of plastic are dumped in the ocean every year. Let’s all agree these are real concerns. We ought to have sound policies to address them. It’s important for the welfare of Americans and has real consequences for U.S. foreign policy. And we can’t lose sight of the fact that generating higher levels of prosperity is a top priority for most humans around the globe—and that includes getting access to affordable, reliable power.
In a 50/50 nation divided on many issues, making progress on protecting our environment remains problematic. We have to depoliticize the conversation. Americans share a common commitment to the general welfare. We all want to protect our environment and safeguard our livelihoods. Yet, we remain deeply splintered on how to move forward.
We are stuck in neutral because there is an undeniable effort to use climate change to drive a far broader agenda for radical political change. Perhaps the best example of this effort is the Green New Deal,  a blueprint for expanding government’s control over the economy  and driving social change. Clothing costly, ineffective climate policies in divisive politics ensures that many Americans will both remain skeptical and actively resist open-ended agendas. Rather than build momentum for action, such a ham-fisted, aggressive approach makes for partisan gridlock and inaction.
Likewise, deliberately inflammatory rhetoric only adds to concerns of fear mongering and manipulation by climate activists. A May 2019  article in the Guardian  offers a case point. “Why the Guardian is Changing the Language It Uses About the Environment” has been referenced by several mainstream sources. The publication updated its official style guide, changing how it uses the term ‘climate change’:
Climate change is no longer considered to accurately reflect the seriousness of the overall situation; use climate emergency or climate crisis instead to describe the broader impact of climate change. However, use climate breakdown or climate change or global heating when describing it specifically in a scientific or geophysical sense e.g. ‘Scientists say climate breakdown has led to an increase in the intensity of hurricanes.
There is little basis for these editorial tweaks, which actively preempt honest debate and understanding with pointed advocacy bordering on propaganda. While the claims are that strong language is essential for “meaningful action,” the opposite is true. Using hyper-partisan language and dismissing debate and counterclaims breeds distrust, suspicion, and opposition. Climate change, by the very nature of the issue, is never going away. The climate is always going to change. Calling it a climate crisis empowers political opportunists to employ a “never let a crises go to waste” strategy indefinitely.
The better approach is to break down climate and environmental challenges into important, meaningful and manageable issues. Engage them all on their own terms. There are top tier challenges that, if effectively addressed, would go a long way toward assuring that we keep our blue dot hospitable for humanity.
Task #1: Recognize China Is the Environment’s Enemy. There is no national policy or multinational effort to deal effectively with  the world’s worst, most aggressive and unrepentant polluter . In fact, the  Chinese Communist Party  views environmental exploitation as just another tool to advance the regime’s global power authority. Any agenda for environmental action that does not put  China’s malignant behavior  front and center and deal equitably with it is not serious about the health of our planet.
At a recent meeting of the UN General Assembly, Chinese President Xi Jinping proclaimed that his country was  leading the world  in responding to climate concerns and protecting the planet. No claim could be more disingenuous. China is the world’s dirtiest country. It spews more greenhouse gases than any other nation and is a leading air polluter. Most of the 1.3 billion tons of plastics that are dumped into the ocean each year come from China. Many of the freshwater scarcity challenges in Asia are linked back to Chinese mismanagement, the Mekong River Delta being a prime example. Chinese fleets are decimating the fishing reserves of other nations. Meanwhile,  China makes a concerted effort to manage international institutions  and shape international agreements (such as the Paris Climate Accord) to nakedly advance Beijing’s interests.
China’s poor environmental record shouldn’t be a surprise. Historically, top-down, centrally managed economies have been terrible for the environment. As Walter Russell Mead recently  wrote  in the Wall Street Journal:
China’s pollution problem results from the intersection of three forces: the rapid rise of its manufacturing economy; a central leadership that has long favored economic growth over competing policy goals like reducing pollution; and a system of governance that creates perverse incentives for local officials and limits the ability of local residents to control decisions that affect their lives.
China’s bad environmental behavior can be curbed only in the context of an overall strategy. To deal successfully with China, the United States must rely on its own unique strengths, while remaining committed to the principles of economic and political freedom.  The United States must also engage all its levers of power , including its strong global presence and partnerships, economic engagement, and clear power projection on the world stage. Anything less won’t compel Beijing to act differently. 
Certainly, entertaining its pro-environment propaganda while setting standards that serve only to facilitate the CCP narrative will never succeed. Meanwhile, the leverage the CCP gains through the illusion of cooperation will only hamstring the United States and its allies from doing what is necessary in other areas. 
Task #2: Embrace a Market-Driven Green Industrial Revolution. Left and Right agree that technology can be a powerful tool for building a better world. Why wouldn’t we all want a new generation of technology that delivers high productivity, greater efficiency, and better environmental outcomes? The centrally-directed government will not deliver on that agenda. In fact, government intervention often stymies innovation and misallocates public and private dollars, meaning economically and environmentally promising technologies may get left behind.
Technological change and innovation on a grand scale is not deterministic. Free nations disadvantage themselves when they compromise on the advantages provided by a free society. Empowering politicians to pick winners and losers in economic competition is as likely to lead to widespread corruption, inefficiencies and corporatism as it is to produce optimal economic and environmental outcomes.
That is not to say that there is no role for government, but that role should be limited to legitimate matters of governance—protecting the rule of law and providing security, not to supplant market choices. A number of initiatives taken by the Trump administration were highly beneficial to facilitating market responses, good governance, and the environment. For example, the United States championed  the Blue Dot Network ,  the Clean Network , and  the Three Seas Initiative . All facilitate global partnerships for improving infrastructure and the energy sector. These should serve as model steps for coordinating international responses to shared environmental concerns.
We need more programs like this to achieve discreet constructive results with “win-win” partnerships that deliver positive environmental, economic and strategic outcomes. We also need trade liberalization.
Task #3: Recognize that Not All Environmental Concerns Are Matters of National Security. While there may be overlap on occasion, these are fundamentally different kinds of public policy issues. National security challenges are about protecting  U.S. vital interests  from adversarial competitors. Environmental policies are based on weighing costs and benefits in activities that impact the public commons and selecting the policies that achieve the optimum outcomes.
Defense resources are already strained to accomplish traditional national security missions.  Lumping everything we think is important into the basket of “national security” dilutes the term, making it harder to prioritize limited resources . Our armed forces are  insufficiently ready to handle more than one major conflict.  That’s a real issue in an age of great-power competition where we face multiple capable and competent adversaries. Our military should not be compelled to undertake a dangerous reorientation away from its real job.
Moreover, the U.S. national security apparatus is broadly ill-suited to effectively address many environmental concerns . That said, there are environmental challenges where national security instruments play an important and legitimate role. One good example is the U.S. Coast Guard’s crucial leadership role in protecting world fisheries.
Task #4: Stop the Empty Promise of Paris. Biden has promised to “re-sign” the Paris climate protocols. That is easy enough to do. The real action is what will be in Biden’s “nationally determined contribution” (NDC). An NDC is a country’s domestic plan to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.
The United States has made remarkable progress in these areas—outside the Paris agreement. Reentering the agreement brings no material benefit for climate action.  If the United States wanted to enter a meaningful agreement, Washington would need a treaty.  Yet Congress would never ratify the Paris accords, not because of political division, but because they fundamentally fail to promote practical international cooperation on climate issues.
It is time to move beyond the unrealistic framework of international wish lists and handouts. What we need from Washington is a constructive agenda, not action for show. Congress and the Biden administration should engage with other countries and pursue fiscally responsible policies that empower the private sector and unleash innovation, not supplant it.
Task # 5: Be a Real Steward of National Resources. While climate activists often talk about transitioning from fossil fuels, in practice they focus mostly on how to restrict fossil fuel use. This disingenuous approach ignores economic reality and the law of unintended consequences.
One area where U.S. policy has to be realistic is in its stewardship and development of American energy sources.  As Heritage environment and energy expert Nicolas Loris points  out, there are only: negligible climate benefits from banning oil and gas production on federal lands…. Banning or restricting oil and natural gas development on federal lands is not going to stop the domestic or global consumption of conventional fuels. Consequently, reducing domestic supplies will increase dependence from sources with far less rigorous environmental standards than the U.S.
Innovative American energy production generates many benefits—including lower energy bills and job creation—with little negative effect on climate. In fact, the shale renaissance—which has reduced reliance on coal-burning plants with cleaner-burning natural gas—is largely responsible for a significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. U.S.-produced liquefied natural gas exports are doing the same. Further, the energy industry has demonstrated the capacity to innovate, improve efficiency, and invest in state-of-the-art technology. All these efforts generate significant economic and environmental benefits. 
If America’s policymakers really want to lead in clean energy production and environmental stewardship, they should reject the government-first policies championed by most countries. Leadership is not about following the pack but blazing new paths forward. 
As the rest of the word relies on government dictates and limiting the choices of their citizens, the United States should recommit to protecting private property rights, get out of the business of picking corporate energy winners and losers, and unleash American’s free-enterprise system to tackle the problems that Americans care about most.
It wouldn’t take long for the world to see that families and businesses, operating in a free market, will yield far better environmental and economic results than any government policy ever could. And that would be U.S. global leadership.

Hockley Confirms Heightened Levels Of COVID-19 Protocols For Third Ashes Test
The third Test is scheduled at the Melbourne Cricket Ground where Level 4 protocols will be followed.

Cricket Australia (CA) chief executive Nick Hockley on Tuesday confirmed the heightened levels of protocols to be implemented from the Boxing Day Test onwards, saying the level had been raised from three to four given the evolving COVID-19 situation.
Australian captain Pat Cummins had to miss the second Ashes Test at the Adelaide Oval after he had come in contact with a COVID-positive person while dining out.

""So for Boxing Day, we'll be going up from our protocol level 3 to Level 4,"" Hockley told SEN Breakfast on Tuesday.
The third Test is scheduled at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), while the fourth and fifth games of the Ashes series will be played at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) and Hobart, respectively.
The COVID-19 situation is evolving differently in different states of Australia. The opening Ashes Test was played in Brisbane (Queensland) with the state COVID-free at that time before it moved to Adelaide (South Australia), where too the virus wasn't prevalent.

But looking at the situation in Victoria and New South Wales, which are averaging thousands of COVID-19 cases daily, the protocol level has been raised.
""We've had different levels of protocols depending on the risk environment… even before the Pat (Cummins) situation, Melbourne and Sydney were higher on the risk level than Brisbane and Adelaide and that was due to the number of cases in the community,"" said Hockley.

""Really the main difference (between Level 3 and 4) is that we ask players to avoid big crowded indoor public settings. They can still go out, still go to the beach, still go to the park. They can still go out for dinner, but we ask them to dine outside and in small groups so if there is another hotspot, the whole group is not caught up. So we're trying to strike that balance between making sure everyone has a great quality of life but also we're able to keep the series going,"" added Hockley.
Cummins has since returned to the squad and will lead the hosts in the third Test at the MCG after he has regularly tested COVID-negative.

By
With a vision to rethink the way we engage professionally with each other, Talent Protocol – a talent tech startup from Lisbon – has just raised €1.5 million and launched the beta version of its platform. 
The funding comes from Protocol Labs, Good News Ventures and Flori Ventures, among other investors. 
Founded in May 2021, Talent Protocol is a web3 platform where talent can use tokens to bootstrap their career, and users can back the people they most believe in. 
The so-called ‘Talent Tokens’ are like purchasing shares in someone career, where both undiscovered talent and their supporters get paid dividends over time. Users of the platform can buy tokens within minutes using crypto or a credit card to back up-and-coming leaders and accelerate their careers – examples include Andrea Solomonides who wants to become the first female President of the Republic of Cyprus, and Abel Rodrigues, a climate activist from the Amazon. 
In the first month, the platform launched 50+ Talent Tokens and is gradually distributing invites to the more than 5000 users on the waitlist to buy those tokens, access exclusive perks and earn weekly rewards.
Filipe Macedo, CMO and Cofounder of Talent Protocol, explained: “Talent Tokens are an unbreakable bond recorded on the blockchain, which bring deeper financial, social, and emotional alignment between a talent and its early supporters. From single-player careers to multiplayer journeys, where success is collective.”
With the new funding, the young startup will grow its team, hiring developers and a designer to build an inclusive and seamless user experience.

EU remains on track to phase-down use of climate-damaging F-gases
News Published 02 Dec 2021 Last modified 02 Dec 2021
2 min read
Topics: Climate change mitigation Policy instruments
The supply and use of climate-warming fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) rose slightly across the European Union and United Kingdom in 2020, according to the latest annual update on the EU’s progress of phasing down the use of F-gases published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.
Consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by European industry continued to decline in line with EU commitments under United Nations agreements, according to the EEA briefing  ‘Fluorinated greenhouse gases 2021 ' .
The briefing provides an update on the data reported by companies on the production, import, export and destruction of fluorinated greenhouse gases in the EU and the UK for 2007-2020. The briefing also outlines the key trends in the EU supply of F-gases and monitors progress under the hydrofluorocarbon phase-down schemes of the EU’s F-gas Regulation and the UN’s Montreal Protocol and its so-called Kigali Amendment. Industry is substituting these F-gases with more climate-friendly products.
F-gases contribute to climate change and made up 2.3% of total EU greenhouse gas emissions, according to the latest data from 2019. These synthetic chemicals are predominantly used in refrigerators, air conditioners and heat pumps. They are considered potent greenhouse gases and have been regulated in the EU since 2006 to reduce their use and impact on global warming.
The EEA assessment also details the different amounts of F-gases supplied for various industrial applications. These are expressed both in physical amounts (in tonnes) and in ‘global warming amounts’, i.e., physical amounts weighted by the global warming potential of hydrofluorocarbon gases and measured in CO2-equivalent tonnes (CO2e).
EU contribution to global phase-down
In 2020, EU-wide placing of hydrofluorocarbons on the market was 4% below the 2020 overall market limit set by the quota system (2% in 2019). The companies that did not fully use their quota counterbalanced the few cases of quota exceedance by importers of bulk HFCs and equipment importers. While the demand for refrigerants remains high, there has been a shift to alternatives with lower global warming potential (GWP).
Other Key Findings:
In 2020, the total supply of fluorinated gases (F-gases) to the EU increased slightly after a continuous decrease from 2015 to 2019. Refrigeration and air conditioning continue to be key applications for these gases.
Despite a 7% increase in hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) consumption compared with 2019, EU consumption of HFCs in 2020 was 52% below the maximum imposed by the Montreal Protocol’s Kigali Amendment.
The EU remains on track under the HFC phase-down phase of the EU F-gas Regulation: EU-wide placing on the market of HFCs in 2020 was 4% below the market limit.
As available HFC quotas have not been fully needed to cover the demand, the reserve of quota authorisations eligible to cover imports of refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump equipment under the HFC phase-down continues to grow. The current size of the reserve accounts for about seven times the amount of such equipment imported in 2020 or 111% of the 2021 EU maximum quantity of HFCs.

Employee incentives can range from small to large, and all should show a renewed commitment to putting the employee first. Ideas to help attract and retain talent in this new business climate include:
• Increased Pay: Undoubtedly this first bullet will make some executives' eyes roll, as the concept of increased wages is not a new one. It is important to recognize that every time a candidate opens LinkedIn or Indeed, they are introduced to an abundance of new opportunities, both part-time and full-time. A competitive wage and compelling compensation package is a way to initially stand out from the noise. You might be asking, “How will this work within our budget?” It is time to reevaluate budgets entirely — take a broad look at every expense and identify areas that may be underutilized or unnecessary.
• Signing Bonuses: Much like mentioned above, we know that talent is in demand, and sign-on bonuses are another way to attract new talent to your organization. An important note with this approach is that these types of incentives may attract more applicants but do not guarantee that they will stay long-term. Incentives and the employee experience should not stop once a candidate is hired, and companies should put just as much emphasis on retaining talent as they do in securing it.
• Wellness Programs: The pandemic most definitely shined a light on mental health and its impact on the work environment. Prioritize your employees' wellness — offer benefits that may include free therapy sessions, gym memberships or increased paid time off (PTO). Support your employees' philanthropies, offering paid days off to volunteer. There are many ways to acknowledge your employees’ wellness and allow them to take care of themselves outside of the workplace, which in turn allows them to be stronger employees inside the workplace.
• Professional Development: Help your employees flourish in their careers by offering training programs, road maps for career growth, industry networking events and so forth. Showing your talent that you are invested in their success long-term will encourage them to continue investing in you. 
Keep Your Business Safe
Incentives are a great way to both allure and retain top talent. Ensuring the safety of your employees as you quickly fill empty positions is just as fundamental. A few recommendations to consider:
• Candidate And Employee Screening: Background checks (my company's specialty) are a vital way to help companies avoid costly bad hires and potential employee issues, and these background checks should not stop at the initial hiring process. Consider implementing a social media screening policy to understand how an employee presents themself online, as well as an ongoing workforce monitoring program to alert you to any employee conduct such as arrests, auto accidents and more. There are many ways to ensure the safety of your workplace, with background checks being an integral part of that process to mitigate risk. As always, it is imperative to consult with legal counsel first to understand the compliance requirements of these screens while also making your policies clear to all candidates and employees.
• Covid-19 In The Workplace: Now is the time for all businesses to decide how they will establish the healthiest work environment possible. Consider if your business should offer or require regular Covid-19 tests, and take the time to formalize your stance on vaccination requirements. Companies need to first understand the legalities surrounding these protocols (both state and federal), and then develop plans that address Covid-19 concerns long-term, as the coronavirus is anticipated to evolve into an endemic and circulate for years. 
Marketing Your Key Differentiators
Attractive employee incentives and a healthy workplace are remarkable ways to differentiate your company from other employers. At the same time, it is just as important to make those benefits known to the talent pool. Consider developing a recruitment and retention plan that promotes the offerings that make your company special and sets you apart from other employers. For example, this recent Amazon commercial cleverly showcases their flexible work schedule and benefits.
2021’s seasonal hiring efforts are facing intimidating hurdles. These hurdles can be overcome with a focus on reimagining your business operations and policies to focus on your people first. Do this, and it truly can be a hiring season that brings in the best talent yet.

17 December 2021
The third in a series of blogs, written by Enya O’Reilly for the Conservation Ecology SIG, giving an overview of COP15 and COP26. This post covers the outcomes of COP26, which took place in November. See part 1 for an introduction to COP15 and part 2 for the outcomes of the COP15 virtual meetings.
On the 1st November, 35,000 people piled into the Scottish Events Centre in Glasgow on the first day of the highly anticipated COP26. Amongst these delegates were representatives from 197 countries involved in two weeks of negotiations to agree on a new climate deal that aimed to ‘keep 1.5oC alive’. World leaders who gathered in Glasgow agreed that we can no longer ignore the science on climate change and that we must act now if we are to ensure a sustainable future. Although leaders from China, Brazil and Russia were not in attendance, it was encouraging to see America re-join the coalition. In order to keep the 1.5oC target in sight, an agreement that would ensure greenhouse gas emissions would be cut by 45% by 2030 was needed. After two weeks of daily events and negotiations, COP26 came to a close and the Glasgow Climate Pact was produced.
Round the clock coverage made it almost impossible to identify the important parts of the proceedings and the final decisions. Here, we have done this for you, and will guide you through the main actions that were agreed at COP26 and how these fit into the Climate Pact.
Finance 
A dominant talking point throughout COP26 was the fact that developed countries previously pledged to provide $100 billion per year of climate finance to developing countries. However, this only reached $80 billion in 2019 .This money is intended to assist developing countries in transitioning to using cleaner energy sources, reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and keep within the 1.5oC limit. Under section 5 of the Glasgow Climate Pact, developed countries have now promised to reach the $100 billion target by 2023, with an expected $500 billion mobilised between 2021 – 2025. Developed countries must now also report on their progress in mobilizing financial aid to developing countries.
The Taskforce on Access to Climate Finance developed by Fiji and the UK will also run trials in 5 developing countries to support faster, easier access to climate finance. $20 billion of public finance will also be given to support developing countries to scale up their clean power and transition away from coal. America, UK, EU, France and Germany have agreed to mobilise $8.5 billion over the next 3 to 5 years to South Africa to decarbonise their coal-dependent power sector whilst supporting the livelihoods of people currently working in the industry. If this is successful then it could be used as a template for other countries.
Adaptation and Adaptation Finance
Under section 2 of the Climate Pact, progress on the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) was set out to scale up action and address the needs of developing countries vulnerable to climate change. Under the GGA, the Glasgow – Sharm el-Sheikh work programme was adopted which aims to increase capabilities to adapt to impacts of climate change and strengthen resilience.
In the COP21 Paris agreement, developed countries pledged to finance climate adaptation and mitigation in equal measures in developing countries. However, only one quarter has so far been used for adaptation. Under section 3 of this Climate Pact, developed countries have now pledged to increase the amount given to climate adaptation by 2025 (from 2019 levels). Similarly, the Adaptation Fund exceeded its 2022 target with contributions of $350 million to developing countries and the Least Developed Countries Fund is due to receive $413 million.
Loss and Damage
Climate-vulnerable countries at COP26 advocated for a new finance facility dedicated to addressing the impact of loss and damage , which will occur despite adaptation efforts. However, this was hindered by rich countries, America in particular, worrying that it amounts to an admission of responsibility which may lead to large liabilities. Instead, a new dialogue dedicated to possible arrangements for loss and damage funding was set up. While this was viewed as insufficient by developing countries, it opens up the possibility to create concrete solutions that can lead to more progress on financing loss and damage in the future. Under section 6 of the Climate Pact, Scotland and Wallonia (Belgium) have pledged £2 million and €1 million respectively towards loss and damage in developing countries. The issues of loss and damage are likely to be a larger talking point at COP27 in Egypt next year.
Mitigation and Implementation 
Under section 4 of the Glasgow Climate Pact, significant action is required to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, and reach net-zero i.e. countries emit no more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere then they remove from it, by 2050. To achieve this, countries must submit ambitious, yet attainable Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs ) to cut their emissions. Leading into COP26, models showed that if countries adhered strictly to their NDCs, global temperatures would still rise  by an average of 2.4oC . By the end of COP26, 153 countries had submitted NDCs, including India’s bold pledge to achieve net zero 2070. Even these agreements do not do enough to keep global temperature increases to within 1.5oC. Without stronger agreements from big emitters including Australia, China, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and Russia, reaching net zero by 2050 is not achievable. Under the Climate Pact, countries that have not yet submitted long-term strategies to reach net zero by 2050 are being asked to do so.
As part of the Climate Pact, countries have also been asked to revisit and strengthen 2030 targets by the end of 2022 rather than in 2025. There is a belief that if countries stick to the original plan and review pledges every 5 years, then the goal for limiting temperature increase to 1.5oC would not be met. We must wait until the end of 2022 to find out if targets have been strengthened and only then will we have a better idea of whether or not 1.5oC is still within reach.
The Climate Pact includes calls for action in four main areas to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; halting and reversing deforestation, reducing methane emissions, phasing down coal power and speeding up the switch to electric vehicles.
Halt deforestation
91% of the world’s forests are now covered by a pledge made by 137 countries at COP26 to halt deforestation and reverse the loss of global forests by 2030 in order to protect biodiversity and utilise forests as a carbon sink. This pledge includes Brazil which contains some of the most diverse and important forests in the world. Unfortunately, Brazil is weakening rather than strengthening its forest protection and representatives for Brazil missed the first press conference after their inclusion in the deal was announced. Also, Indonesia were rethinking their inclusion in this forest deal a few days after this agreement was made. On a more positive note, 12 developed countries pledged $12 billion of public climate finance from 2021 to 2025 towards the Global Forest Finance Pledge and contributors pledged $1.7 billion to advance Indigenous Peoples’ and local communities’ rights within forest habitat and support their role as guardians of the forest and nature between 2021 and 2025.
Reduce methane emissions
100 countries pledged to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030 . This includes six of the world’s top 10 methane emitters; US, Brazil, EU, Indonesia, Pakistan and Argentina. Although methane is a powerful and harmful greenhouse gas, this was the first COP to include a major event on methane. This pledge and the pledge on deforestation are vital to keeping the 1.5oC target in reach.
Phase-down coal power
In a last minute turnaround by India and China, the initial intention to phase-out coal was changed to a phase-down . Vulnerable countries in particular were disappointed with this change but agreed to accept it in order to preserve other aspects of the Climate Pact. However, 46 countries, including the UK, have committed to the phase out of domestic coal use . Unfortunately, this pledge does not include the world’s 5 biggest consumers of coal; China, India, US, Japan and Russia, nor does it include Australia, which is the world’s fourth largest producer, but exports around 90% of the fossil fuel. This pledge also does not necessarily hold committed countries accountable for their actions.
Zero-emission vehicles
Vehicle manufacturers representing 30% of the global market have committed to 100% zero emission vehicle production by 2030. With this, 30 countries have pledged that all new car and van sales will be zero emission by 2040.
Collaboration
Section 8 of the Glasgow Climate Pact highlights the importance of collaboration in two fundamental areas; improvement of technological and scientific advances, and ensuring the inclusion of civil society, indigenous peoples, women and youth. A strong emphasis was put on interdisciplinary collaboration at COP26 to advance technology across multiple sectors. 40 countries, accounting for 70% of global GDP, endorsed the Glasgow Breakthroughs which looks to speed up the global access to clean power, zero-emission vehicles, near-zero emission steel and affordable and renewable carbon hydrogen. Co-ordinated by the UK, there was also greater emphasis on movements outside the official COP26 process for smaller groups of countries, companies and cities to collaborate and come up with their own climate targets. For example, reducing methane emissions and greening the financial services industry. In addition to these, the Clydebank Declaration was adopted at COP26 whereby 22 countries pledged to work together to develop green shipping corridors.
Paris Rulebook
An important achievement at COP26 was the finalisation of the Paris Rulebook which sets out detailed protocols that underpin the delivery of the Paris Agreement. The outstanding rules that were agreed upon at COP26 were the regulation of the carbon credits system and common timeframes for emission reduction targets. International carbon markets have been a heavily debated topic for the last 5 years. In essence, the global carbon market is the sale of credits generated through emission-reducing projects to buyers (countries or companies) looking to fulfil an emission-reduction target. Negotiators at COP26 agreed to avoid double-counting i.e. where at least 2 countries claim the same emission reductions as counting towards their own climate commitments. It was also agreed that 5% of proceeds be used to fund climate adaptation and that countries are allowed to carry over carbon credits since 2013. However, at the next COP it is vital that these older credits be representative of real emission reductions.
Common timeframes for NDCs between countries were also agreed. For this first round only, 2022 targets are for an end date of 2030, and then a 5 year cycle starts. 2025 targets are for a 2035 end date, 2030 targets for a 2040 end date and so on. With this, countries are expected to increase their ambition and goals with each 5-year review of the targets in what is known as the ‘ratchet-system’. Now that the Paris Rulebook has been finalised, the Paris Agreement can be fully put into action.
 
As it stands, the current Climate Pact will not put the world on track to stay within the 1.5oC limit, but officials say that the agreement is a significant step to a safer future . We will need huge ambition and targets that are followed through if we are to keep 1.5oC alive. However, every effort, no matter how big or small, chips away at temperature increases and the damage that they will cause.

Fatal lab explosion in China highlights wider safety fears
Deaths caused by university lab blasts have some scientists in China concerned about a lack of oversight and standardized safety protocols, especially in teaching labs.

The deaths of two people following a laboratory explosion at a Chinese university in October have raised alarm among researchers. The full circumstances that led to the deaths at the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA), in Jiangsu province, are not yet known — but they come amid wider concerns about safety in university teaching labs in China.
The deaths are the latest in a series of fatalities caused by explosions in academic laboratories in China, often involving students in chemistry departments, that have been reported in recent years. Some researchers are optimistic that the situation is improving. But others say China’s government needs to do more to improve safety.
Be mindful of your safety in the lab
In the recent incident, nine people were injured and two died as a result of an explosion just before 4 p.m. in the NUAA’s College of Materials Science and Technology, according to a 24 October post by the university on the social-media network Weibo. The NUAA said this week that an investigation was ongoing, but declined to answer Nature’s questions regarding the safety of its laboratories.
Earlier this year, on 31 March, a graduate student was killed following an explosion at the Institute of Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. Previous lab blasts led to deaths of three students conducting a sewage-treatment experiment at Beijing Jiaotong University in December 2018; one death in the chemistry department at Tsinghua University in Beijing in December 2015; and one death in a chemistry lab at the China University of Mining and Technology in Xuzhou in April 2015.
It’s not possible to say what the cause was of any individual explosion and death without a full investigation report — none of which have been made public except for the incident at Beijing Jiaotong University — and some may not have been caused by negligence or lack of safety procedures.
‘Renewed safety concerns’
But a study 1 that focussed on safety in graduate and undergraduate teaching labs, and was published online last month, claims that “the past two decades have seen a rise in university laboratory accidents in China.”
Led by researchers at the China University of Petroleum in Qingdao, the team looked at 110 publicly reported lab accidents in China between 2000 and 2018, finding that they had led to 102 injuries and 10 fatalities. But researchers think that the true number of accidents is likely to be significantly under-reported, as its likely some incidents are never made public.
The authors of the study note that the number of graduate students enrolled in laboratory-related disciplines in China ballooned from 90,000 in 2000 to about 5.3 million in 2019 — and the number of labs grew along with them, which they say may be part of the reason accidents have increased in number.
After the Nanjing blast, Chinese state news outlet Global Times said the incident had triggered “renewed safety concerns,” adding that “Chinese chemists have been calling for improvements to lab safety at research institutions following previous incidents, which reflect systematic negligence of safety.”
Saad Javed, a systems scientist at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology who has studied and worked at the NUAA, worries that little has been learnt from the string of accidents at Chinese universities, and that more needs to be done to improve university governance to prevent future incidents.

Nature asked the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing Jiaotong University, Tsinghua University and the China University of Mining and Technology if problems with safety may have been linked to the incidents at their institutions and whether there is a wider problem with safety in university labs in China, but all either declined to answer or did not respond.
Very few countries keep detailed records on numbers of university lab accidents. But in many countries deaths seem to be rare. In the United States, for example, the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board listed only one fatality related to a chemical incident at a university between 2001 and mid-2018. According to the Laboratory Safety Institute, which maintains an informal online memorial wall for researchers killed in labs, Germany and France each had one fatality from a lab incident over the same period, while the UK had none.
Safety is an issue globally
However, China has far more students than many other countries, so it's difficult to say if it has a larger number of lab-related deaths per capita and researchers note that lab safety is an issue in many countries. Some also question the idea that incidents are becoming more frequent in China and argue that serious accidents were probably happening 15–20 years ago as well, but they just weren’t reported publicly before the rise of the Internet and social media.
Still other researchers in China who spoke to Nature say that some universities don’t place enough emphasis on lab experience and training for students, and some senior staff may even not have had enough safety training. Some institutions “don’t produce students with basic practical skills required to work in any research lab with hazards”, says one experimental physicist in China, who didn’t want to be named.
Yang Guang-Fu, a chemist who studies pesticides at Central China Normal University in Wuhan, agrees that there is a severe shortage of staff with safety expertise, that rules are poorly enforced and that the administrations of some Chinese universities don’t attach enough importance to safety.
Jason Chruma, an organic chemist at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, who was a professor and then an assistant dean at Sichuan University in Chengdu from 2012 to 2020 says that some government safety regulations are not clear, are interpreted differently from place to place and are difficult for the government to enforce.
Although he can’t comment on current practices, Chruma says that during his time at Sichuan University he sometimes saw safety issues first hand, such as students conducting chemical reactions in hallways because there weren’t enough fume hoods in busy labs.
Sichuan University didn’t respond to Nature’s questions regarding the safety of its laboratories.
According to the November study, the 2018 explosion at Beijing Jiaotong University — which led to the deaths of three students and destroyed an entire laboratory — was caused by the ignition of 66 kilograms of improperly stored magnesium dust. The authors report that this was the first university lab accident in China for which a detailed investigation was conducted and the results were reported on a government website.

Optimism of improvements
Some researchers are optimistic that the safety situation is improving, as it has in many countries in recent decades.
“Compared with 20 years ago, lab safety in China has definitely made significant progress,” says Samuel Yu, director of the Health, Safety and Environment Office at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. He says big improvements include the addition of safety features such as fume cupboards and emergency showers. This “is most obvious in the leading universities”, he says.
Denis Simon, who was executive vice-chancellor of Duke Kunshan University in Jiangsu province from 2015 to 2020, agrees that “this is a country that has come a tremendously long way in improving the protocols”. But he says that China needs more specialists with a career focus on lab safety, and that grant awards should require certification of lab safety protocols for funded projects.
Health and safety: Danger zone
However, Yu doubts there is a simple solution to the problem in China. “The fatal lab accidents that we are aware of usually have multiple faults adding up to the tragic outcome, so I don’t think there is a single magic bullet,” he says.
The concerns over university teaching labs in China follow a debate over whether the COVID pandemic might have started in a lab in China. But Gigi Gronvall, a biosecurity specialist at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, who has visited labs in China, says that there is no reason to think that the problems flagged in student chemistry labs in China reveal anything about the biological research labs that handle dangerous pathogens.
“I wouldn’t necessarily assume that those same problems are occurring with biological organisms,” she says. Even the kind of non-teaching biological research labs that do quite advanced experiments don’t use dangerous pathogenic organisms, which typically require extensive safety training and follow more stringent safety standards.

In the North of England, in a tiny village called Drax, there is a power plant, also called Drax. The name is ominous: the sad honk of a mistake, ending in a hazardous-chemical “X.” In the taxi there, from my hotel in nearby Selby, in North Yorkshire, we travelled through flat, green countryside in cool, gray weather, until all at once the plant came horribly into view—it attacked the horizon, beyond enormous, beyond ugly, a row of twelve concrete cooling-tower children, each standing three hundred and fifty feet tall, but dwarfed by their mean and looming dad, an eight-hundred-and-fifty-foot chimney.
“Dear God,” I said to the taxi-driver. “How utterly terrifying!”
“The chimney is the tallest one in all of the United Kingdom,” the driver said. He was sixtyish, jolly but absent. His car smelled of ashtray. “It’s so tall that they used to get the acid rain from it over there in—well, in Scandinavia and the like!” He snickered. “They weren’t too pleased about that, Sweden.” He dragged out the long “E.”
“Well,” I said, trying to match his spirit, “I suppose they all should have thought about that before they decided to live there!”
He loved this. He slapped his knee. We were pulling up to the entrance of Drax: neat corporate shrubbery, fencing, a small reception building. “Should have thought of that before they lived there, heh heh heh,” he said as I paid the fare. “Have fun at Drax, luv,” he called after me.
I had come to Drax to understand how this power station is “enabling a zero carbon, lower cost energy future,” as described by the annual report of the Drax Group, which operates four renewable-energy plants across England and Scotland. The Drax plant, which dates back to 1974, used to burn coal, but it has spent the last few years transitioning to “sustainably sourced biomass,” more commonly known as wood pellets.
In essence, Drax is a gigantic woodstove. In 2019, Drax emitted more than fifteen million tons of CO2, which is roughly equivalent to the greenhouse-gas emissions produced by three million typical passenger vehicles in one year. Of those emissions, Drax reported that 12.8 million tons were “biologically sequestered carbon” from biomass (wood). In 2020, the numbers increased: 16.5 million tons, 13.2 million from biomass. Meanwhile, the Drax Group calls itself “the biggest decarbonization project in Europe,” delivering “ a decarbonized economy and healthy forests .”
The apparent conflict between what Drax does and what it says it does has its origins in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change of 1997. The conference established the Kyoto Protocol, which was intended to reduce emissions and “prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” The U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (I.P.C.C.) classified wind and solar power as renewable-energy sources. But wood-burning was harder to categorize: It’s renewable, technically, because trees grow back. In accounting for greenhouse gases, the I.P.C.C. sorts emissions into different “ sectors ,” which include land-use and energy production. It’s hard to imagine now, but at the time, the I.P.C.C. was concerned that if they counted emissions from harvesting trees in the land sector, it would be duplicative to count emissions from the burning of pellets in the energy sector.
According to William Moomaw, an emeritus professor of international environmental policy at Tufts University, and lead author of several I.P.C.C. reports, negotiators thought of biomass as only a minor part of energy production—small-scale enough that forest regrowth could theoretically keep up with the incidental harvesting of trees. “At the time these guidelines were drawn up, the I.P.C.C. did not imagine a situation where millions of tons of wood would be shipped four thousand miles away to be burned in another country,” Moomaw said.
In the end, negotiators decided only to count land-use emissions. “But these emissions are very difficult to estimate, and the United States and Canada aren’t even part of the Kyoto agreement,” Moomaw said. The loss of future carbon uptake due to the removal of forests, even the plumes chugging out of a biomass plant’s smokestacks —these did not go on the books.
The result was what many scientists call the “carbon accounting loophole.” By international agreement, if a nation or industry burns megatons of wood, thereby emitting megatons of carbon, it can be defined as a largely carbon-neutral event. “The wood biomass energy claims of carbon neutrality are incorrect and misleading,” Beverly Law, a professor of global climate-change biology at Oregon State, told me. “It can worsen climate change even if wood displaces coal.”
In 2009, the European Commission passed the Renewable Energy Directive to enforce the guidelines set up in Kyoto. It required nations to reduce emissions by twenty per cent or more by 2020. In the decade that followed, European nations were slow to establish solar or wind infrastructure. What Europe did have in abundance were coal plants. Converting the plants from burning coal to burning wood was relatively easy. The biomass-emissions loophole made it attractive. “Countries had to meet their renewable-energy targets,” Scot Quaranda, the communications director of the Dogwood Alliance, a forest-protection N.G.O. based in North Carolina, told me. “There was no way to do it without gaming the system and counting biomass as carbon neutral.” Coal plants such as Drax, Ørsted Energy’s Avedøre power station, in Denmark; and the Rodenhuize thermal power plant, in Belgium; started to transition from coal to wood pellets. (Ali Lewis, the head of media and public relations for Drax, disputed Quaranda’s description. “How can we be ‘gaming the system’ when the carbon accounting for biomass is derived from the principles set by the world’s leading climate scientists at the U.N. I.P.C.C., and we follow those rules to the letter?” Lewis asked.)
In 2017, the E.U. spent six and a half billion euros on subsidies for biomass plants. Last year, Drax got about $1.1 billion from the British government. “The governments can claim they are compliant, while former coal companies that would have been dead get rich on government subsidies and selling electricity—much of which, with proper planning, could have come from wind and solar,” Quaranda said. “The forests are destroyed, and the world burns.”

By 2019, biomass accounted for about fifty-nine per cent of all renewable-energy use in the E.U. The Dogwood Alliance estimates that sixty thousand acres of trees—trees that would have otherwise sequestered carbon—are burned each year to supply the growing pellet market. Global demand for wood pellets is expected to double by 2027, to more than thirty-six million tons. And although the entire premise of burning wood as renewable energy hinges on the assumption that trees grow back, there is no binding governmental or industrial oversight for replanting trees at all. “There’s no requirement that Drax or anyone has to replant trees, and no requirement that whatever they’re planting has to come back as natural forest,” Quaranda said.
Even if there were strict protocols for replanting trees, it takes between forty and a hundred years for a new tree to pay down the carbon debt racked up by logging and burning an old one. In 2018, when Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump, declared that the U.S. would now consider burning wood to be “carbon neutral,” a group of climate scientists wrote an Op-Ed for the Times condemning the decision. “Throughout the many decades before the replacement forests can grow enough to remove the extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere,” they wrote, “the previously added gas will thaw more permafrost and melt more ice, make ocean acidification worse, accelerate global warming, speed sea-level rise, increase the incidence of extreme weather, worsen drought and water stress, and hurt crop yields—effects that will persist for centuries or longer.”
At the recent U.N. climate-change conference in Glasgow ( COP26 ), a dominant issue, as in past conferences, was that governments and businesses are underreporting emissions. Yet there was relatively little conversation about the biomass loophole. If anything, in Glasgow, the E.U. appeared to be doubling down on biomass. “To be perfectly blunt with you, biomass will have to be part of our energy mix if we want to remove our dependency on fossil fuels,” Frans Timmermans, the European Commission’s executive vice president for the European Green Deal, told reporters . Meanwhile, the Earth’s atmosphere continues to absorb enormous amounts of carbon that don’t officially exist.
A group tour of the Drax power plant, which I took in 2019, began in a visitor’s center with glossy floors, high ceilings, black-and-white photographs of coal mines past, and a model of a nineteenth-century turbine. It looked like a science classroom in a public school in a town with a healthy tax base. The walls were papered with positive newspaper headlines: “Drax Leads Europe in Green Power,” “Power Station Looks to an Eco-Friendly Future.” Of the fifteen or so people who joined the group tour, four were boys under the age of ten. Two brothers, aged around seven and nine, cowlicked and big-eared, accepted their hard hats and safety vests from the tour guides with bashful excitement. A tiny kid, maybe in kindergarten, adorable in his tracksuit—a mini-Jason Statham—clung to his mother’s leg.
One of the tour guides—white, tall, bald, mid-fifties, rimless glasses, Dad sense of humor—called us all to attention by holding up a small clear jar of wood pellets. “What can you all tell me about biomass?” he asked. Silence. “Very quiet group today.” The adults smiled expectantly; the children took stock of their reflections on the floor.
Finally, one of the cowlicked brothers said, “It’s natural?”
The tour guide was delighted. “That’s right!” he exclaimed. He shook the little jar as the boy looked down with shy, secret pleasure. “This is residue from the timber industry, made out of scraps and sawdust.” The tour guide had a musical Welsh accent and he swayed back and forth, as if to the sound of it. He passed the sad vial of orphan timber residue around the room and asked if anyone knew where the wood came from. “No, we don’t get it from England. No, we don’t get it from Germany. Can we do better? Perhaps, maybe? A bit better?”
“The United States,” I piped up. People laughed, because the person with the American accent had said “United States.”
“That’s right,” the tour guide said again. “We don’t have a timber industry in the U.K., so we don’t have all the waste that they have there in the United States, and also Canada. They have all these lovely trees, for making things and so on, they cut down these trees, make those things, furniture, boards, you know, and we just use the bits of the trees they are not using.”
Drax burns wood pellets from pellet mills situated mostly in the U.S. and Canada. In the South, there are four Drax-owned mills and several more owned by one of Drax’s largest suppliers, called Enviva. In Canada, there is Pinnacle Renewable Energy, which Drax bought this year . These operations cut down a lot of trees: pine and hardwood forests in the South; and spruce, pine, and red cedars in British Columbia. Some of this activity is in primary-growth forests—forests that have never before been logged. Pellets made from these trees are shipped from ports (Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is one; Prince Rupert, British Columbia, is another) to England, where they are loaded onto custom-built trains, brought to Drax, and burned to supply around six per cent of the electricity used in the U.K.
The Dogwood Alliance has extensive photographic evidence of whole trees in North Carolina and Virginia being piled up on trucks that are headed for Enviva’s pellet mills, which require some fifty-seven thousand acres of timber per year to operate. Conservation North, a community group in British Columbia working to protect primary forests, has taken aerial photographs of thousands of hectares of forests in British Columbia that the provincial government has licensed to the Drax subsidiary Pinnacle Renewable Energy. These forests were recently shorn clean of their spruce, birch, and pine trees. “Those forests went to Pinnacle and then went to the Drax power plant to be burned,” Michelle Connolly, the director of Conservation North, told me.
This evidence conflicts with Drax’s official promotional materials. According to a Drax-produced virtual tour , the wood it burns for biomass is “made from tiny pieces of sawdust” that are “made when the trunk of the tree is cut into the big pieces needed for construction and furniture.” Minutes later in the same video, you see whole trees being loaded into a debarking machine, as a narrator speaks about “sustainably sourced forest thinning and low-grade wood.”
When I first asked a Drax spokesperson, Selina Williams, about this evidence of clear-cutting, she challenged me for using the word “logging.” “Pinnacle isn’t a logging company,” Williams said repeatedly. When I restated “logging” as “tree-cutting-down,” she repeated the phrase in a derisive tone: “Tree-cutting-down? What do you mean by tree-cutting-down?” Eventually, she said, “Canada has one of the most regulated forest industries in the world and has laws requiring a specified annual cut to minimize the risk of pest, disease, and fire.”
Conservation North’s fight is less with Drax or Pinnacle than it is with the British Columbian government, which, Connolly said, “won’t acknowledge that primary forests exist and are important for wildlife habitat and as carbon sinks.” There’s another loophole at work here: under international definitions, if a government or private entity cuts down a forest but doesn’t develop the land, it has not officially engaged in deforestation. “There aren’t any laws against primary-forest degradation in B.C. and Canada,” Connolly said. Canada’s forests used to be one of the biggest carbon sinks in the world, but about ten years ago, due to a combination of logging and natural disasters such as fire and drought, they began emitting more carbon than they absorb. (According to Lewis, the Drax spokesperson, “forty-three per cent of the material used to make all of our pellets comes from sawmill residues,” and “the proportion is much higher in Canada, where our operations use around eighty per cent sawmill residues.”)
On the Drax tour, the message about making good use of the timber industry’s castoffs seemed to resonate. “It’s wonderful that they’ve come up with a use for all that leftover wood,” mini-Jason Statham’s mother said as she looked up at one of the massive cooling towers.
“It certainly is,” the tour guide said. “So, there’s ten steel balls sitting inside each of those pulverizing mills, where we will visit later, and what they do is turn those pellets into what, well, pellet powder, and the fuel drops in, it burns, the ash pops out the bottom, all happy there? Any questions, happy, mostly? All very happy?”
Later that day, I spotted the mother of the cowlicked boys quizzing them about what they had learned. “Why do they burn the wood?” she asked.
“Because no one else wants it?” one replied.
“That’s right,” she said, beaming.
The tour group boarded a transport van to drive around the Drax complex. Drax is in the middle of the English countryside, but once you enter the gates, you feel like the only thing around Drax is more Drax. There are a few brutalist-lite concrete office buildings, connected by walkways. Otherwise, the buildings are strictly industrial, housing the boilers and pulverizers and furnaces, surrounded by those two sets of six cooling towers and turbine halls, with the smokestack somewhere in the middle of it all. We passed through some open space of scrubby vegetation—about forty-seven acres—and paused in front of a giant pile of coal. “This all used to be coal in here,” the tour guide said. It was still a lot of coal.
We pulled up to a giant, open-ended metal shed, where railroad tracks came in one side and out the other. Here, trains bearing the slogan “ Powering Tomorrow ” carry pellets in from the English ports. Seventeen trains per day, with twenty-eight cars each, bring twenty thousand tons of pellets to this shed every single day.
Drax, like England itself, has an ambivalent relationship with coal. Working in a coal mine meant you risked being suffocated in a pit or by your own lungs for a paycheck, but it was a steady living. At its peak, in the nineteen-twenties, the British coal industry employed more than a million people. By 1990, it was fifty thousand; by 2016, just a thousand. During the 1984-85 miners’ strikes, Margaret Thatcher made trade unions her enemy, but it was also simply much cheaper for England to import coal than to mine it. As the coal industry collapsed, work in England became predominantly urban and either professionalized or service-oriented. The towns where people once did physical labor to maintain the country’s infrastructure became places to sleep and be unemployed in. The last large-scale underground coal mine in Great Britain—Kellingley, which is also in North Yorkshire, about twelve miles from Drax—closed in 2015. The Selby coalfield, also in the area, once employed three thousand five hundred people; today, Drax employs about seven hundred.

Many of the people living in and around Drax have solid jobs with the government, or with a large sixth-form school called Selby College, or at nearby York University. Wealthier residents commute to York or even London. But there are also a lot of residents who are unemployed, underemployed, doing contract work, or working in low-wage service jobs. I talked to Steven Shaw-Wright, a councilperson in Selby, on Zoom, about the economic landscape of the Selby area. He described an indoor-amusement-park chain twelve miles from Selby, called XScape, which is also home to cinemas and restaurants. It’s built on the site of a former coal mine. “XScape’s got lots of jobs, but those jobs pay ten quid an hour, as opposed to the decent money that the pit used to pay,” Shaw-Wright said.
Then, there was Drax. “Drax is a really good employer, they pay really good wages,” Shaw-Wright said. People in the Selby area are very pro-Drax, he sensed. “They do attract attention from climate-change activists from time to time, to stop the chips and the burning and the carbon. But locally, they do lots of environmental projects. They fund community groups.” Drax is “a source of income for the community,” and “that money gets spent locally, in the pubs and shops, and people are quite happy with that.” According to Shaw-Wright, of the nearly forty-two million dollars of business tax accrued in the Selby district over the last year, about twelve million came from Drax.
Among the newspaper clippings tacked to the wall of the Drax visitor’s center is “Clean Coal Project Would See 1,250 Jobs at Drax,” announcing a carbon-capture and storage project named White Rose. The article, from the Yorkshire Post, was published in 2012; White Rose never came to fruition. It was not the first time Drax promised jobs that did not appear, Shaw-Wright said. But he remains optimistic about Drax’s future as a local employer and about the region’s future in the green-energy sector. He mentioned windmills and solar projects in nearby Goole and Hull. A carbon-capture partnership has started between Drax and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries that could create more than fifty thousand jobs in the U.K. “The younger people want something to look forward to,” he said.
Carbon capture was a recurring theme of the Drax tour. The guide explained the concept of C.C.S., which stands for “carbon capture and storage.” “Before the carbon can even leave that big smokestack, Drax is intervening, and binding it with a solvent, and burying it in the ground,” he said. “It’s a matter of balancing what’s being used with what’s being replaced. Wood is a sustainable material because they’re taking it away as they’re replacing it.”
“The solvent looks like really runny honey,” a second tour guide added. She wore a Drax polo and a fluorescent safety vest. She was about thirty, with meticulous makeup and a pearlescent pink manicure.
“Oh right, I’ve heard about that program,” I said. “That’s so cool. How much carbon have they captured? I just read about it the other day. Like a thousand tons a day or something?”
She giggled into her hand and the other tour guide barked outright. “That would be nice, wouldn’t it?” she said.
The idea behind C.C.S. and similar technologies—such as BECCS, which stands for “bioenergy with carbon capture and storage”—is to treat carbon emissions with an enzyme that binds to the CO2 so that it can be liquified and eventually sequestered underground. It sounds great, until you get to the part where no one has figured out how to capture and store enough carbon to make any difference. Almuth Ernsting, the co-director of Biofuelwatch, an international anti-biomass-industry N.G.O., told me, “Drax has never actually stored a single pound of carbon.” (“With government support, the first BECCS unit at Drax could be operational in 2027 with a second in 2030,” a Drax spokesperson told me.)
Chevron and Shell, among other fossil-fuel companies, have spent billions on carbon-capture initiatives, as have some governments; the Obama Administration funded $2.4 billion in carbon-capture development projects. In July, around five hundred environmental organizations—including Biofuelwatch, the Dogwood Alliance, the Indigenous Environmental Network, and Waterkeeper Alliance—sent an open letter to President Biden and other government officials expressing their skepticism toward C.C.S. “CCS projects implemented to date have systematically overpromised and under-delivered on emissions reductions,” they wrote. “Despite the billions of taxpayer dollars spent by governments in both the United States and Canada on CCS over the last ten-plus years, the technology has not made a dent in CO2 emissions.”
In his speech at COP26 , Biden emphasized that slowing climate change is a job-creator (for “the engineers who will design new carbon capture systems” and “the construction workers who will make them a reality,” among others). Limiting global warming, Biden said, “is a moral imperative, but it’s also an economic imperative—if we fuel greater growth, new jobs, and better opportunities for all our people.” Biden’s comments underlined the big problem, which isn’t Drax or even the biomass industry. The problem is “the economy,” which is required to produce profits and reproduce itself, and which requires huge energy inputs to do so. We are witnessing the complete breakdown of weather patterns. We are enduring floods and wildfires and watching the Earth that sustains us die. The Colorado River is about to disappear . The Gulf Stream is in jeopardy. Monsoons in South Asia displaced millions of people this summer. We do hear about all this on the news, but we hear much more about “the economy.” Even as we watch economic growth literally killing us, it is what we talk about before we talk about anything else—we are told, over and over, that we must run to it for help. The truth is that if the economy is not entirely unmade, the debates over the folly of biomass, over what counts as renewable, over whether or not a tree can grow back faster than it burns—all of it will vanish into a great silence.
In October, Drax lost its place on the S. & P. Global Clean Energy Index, as did Albioma, a biomass company in France, after analysts expressed skepticism about the true carbon neutrality of their operations. But Drax doesn’t appear to be at any risk of losing its government subsidies, and as energy prices spiked in the U.K. amid the fuel crisis this fall, Drax’s share price rose to its highest point in seven years.
The taxi-driver who took me back to my hotel in Selby loves Drax. “I drive to Drax a lot. I had the fella from the United States who sells the trees to Drax in my car,” he told me. He was in his late sixties and white. He said he used to be an engineer. “What they have come up with is so ingenious,” he said. “They burn trees, but they used to burn coal. But you can replant trees. It’s just brilliant.”
“Well, yes,” I said, “but wood also emits CO2.”
We went back and forth like this, the taxi-driver and I. I said that within fifty years, if the CO2 in the atmosphere reaches five hundred parts per million and London, Jakarta, Houston, New Orleans, Venice, Lagos, and Bangkok are all underwater and California is being deserted and India and parts of Africa are reaching a hundred and forty degrees, what are we going to do? Are we going to tell the atmosphere to hold on a minute, those wood-burning emissions don’t count, and we promise the CO2 from the trees we burned in the twenty-twenties should be cancelled out soon?
“Yeah, but they’re going to do carbon capture,” the taxi-driver said.
“I don’t think that really works,” I said.
“Sure it does,” he said. “It’s in the newspaper. You should read about it. They’re working on it right here at Drax.”

DUP Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots is facing legal action for not securing the wider approval of the Stormont Executive for port checks required by the Northern Ireland Protocol (Brian Lawless/PA)

A DUP minister is facing legal action for not securing the wider approval of the Stormont Executive for port checks required by the Northern Ireland Protocol.
A pre-action letter has been served on Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots, stating an intention to commence judicial review proceedings if he does not declare an intent to refer decisions on the checks and inspections to his Executive colleagues for approval.
Mr Poots and his Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs are under a legal obligation to fulfil the commitment made by the UK Government in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement to carry out checks on goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain.
If the case, brought by a group called Unionist Voice Policy Studies, is successful, and Mr Poots is required to refer decisions around continuing or intensifying the checks to the Executive, it could raise the prospect of the DUP using a Stormont veto mechanism to try to thwart the moves.

New support announced for businesses as restrictions begin to bite
That could then potentially put the administration at odds with the UK Government’s legal duty to implement protocol checks.
The protocol, which was agreed by the EU and UK as a way to keep the Irish land border free-flowing post-Brexit, has created a series of new customs and regulatory barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
Negotiations between London and Brussels to resolve issues with the operation of the protocol are due to resume in the new year.
A series of grace periods limiting the volume of checks required under the protocol have been indefinitely extended by the UK.
The pre-action protocol letter, seen by the PA news agency, argues that, under the terms of Stormont’s Ministerial Code, Mr Poots is obliged to refer any significant or controversial decisions to the Executive for approval.
“It is trite to point out that the imposition of the protocol is highly significant and controversial,” the letter stated.
“That this is so is beyond any rational dispute.”
Mr Poots did not refer the protocol checks to the Executive for approval before the introduction of the arrangements in January this year.

Former DUP agriculture minister Gordon Lyons, who stood in for Mr Poots while he was recovering from a cancer operation, caused controversy in February when he tried to halt work on constructing permanent checking infrastructure without seeking prior approval of the Executive.
Any judicial review would face a potentially significant legal hurdle on the issue of delay, and why it has been initiated almost a year after the protocol became operational.
The applicant argues that the ministerial duty to refer a matter to the Executive is “ongoing” and contends that an issue which starts out as being benign can later become significant and controversial due to other factors.
Loyalist activist Jamie Bryson, which is the named person taking forward the case on behalf of the group, said a separate recent legal challenge related to the protocol had demonstrated that the issue passed the threshold for being considering significant or controversial.
He said the case brought by Belfast businessman Sean Napier against the DUP’s unlawful boycott of north-south political meetings, as part of its protest over the protocol, had established that the party was prepared to break the law to demonstrate its opposition to the Brexit trading arrangements.
“It is very clear that a significant and controversial issue must be brought to the Executive, and in the absence of agreement the minister is deprived of authority to act in relation to the disputed issue,” he said.
“The Napier application has made clear – via outlining the DUP’s protest which the court has declared unlawful – just how controversial and contentious the implementation of the protocol is.
“Minister Poots should therefore simply refer the matter to the Executive.
Lawfare is better than warfare
Loyalist activist Jamie Bryson
“Naturally, if he were to be blocked by the Executive, then he would in fact have no power to implement the protocol at all.”
Mr Bryson acknowledged that his move could be viewed as an attempt to “game” Stormont’s veto mechanisms to prevent protocol checks.
He said the judgment in the Napier case highlighted that the system of governance at Stormont relies on the “goodwill” of the parties involved – an area in which the court expressed a reluctance to intervene.
“Goodwill is not a legal requirement,” he added.
“Given the way unionism has been treated, goodwill is – or should be – in short supply.
“If some take the view this is an effort to game the mechanisms, then so be it.
“The ultimate objective is the dismantling of the Union-subjugating protocol, and in that regard the ends justify the means.

International travellers, subjected to mandatory RT-PCR testing at Bengaluru airport, complain of data connectivity issues
With the Karnataka government implementing a policy of mandatory RT-PCR testing of all foreign arrivals in Bengaluru – even those from the US who transit via Europe – one of the problems passengers are facing on arrival in Bengaluru, apart from long waits, is data connectivity that will enable them to go through the process of testing and receiving their reports on their devices.
Several passengers who have landed in Bengaluru since the mandatory RT-PCR testing norms came into force - after the emergence of the new Omicron variant of the Covid 19 virus last week – have found themselves in a spot at the airport since much of the testing process involves usage of mobile phones with a working net connection on arrival.

Most BMTC AC buses stay off roads as passenger demand plummets
Bengaluru, December 8: The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has been running only 200 air-conditioned (AC) buses in the last few months, whereas the remaining 660 units of its 860-strong AC bus fleet have not been operated since the imposition of the pandemic-induced lockdown in March last year, sources said.
When asked why all the buses are not being put into service, a BMTC officer said there was hardly any demand for the buses on most routes. “During pre-Covid times, these buses used to cater to people employed in the Information Technology sector. But as many now work from home, there is no demand for these buses,” the BMTC officer told indianexpress.com. Darshan Devaiah BP reports

SEATTLE — The NHL announced Monday that the matchup between the Arizona Coyotes and Seattle Kraken has been postponed due to COVID-19 seriously affecting Seattle’s roster.
The game was scheduled for Tuesday night at Climate Pledge Arena. A new date hasn’t been announced.
Seattle announced that an unidentified player tested positive for coronavirus as the club contends with a rotating cast of athletes moving in and out of health protocols.
Kraken officials canceled Monday’s practice, and the league previously postponed Seattle’s game against the Calgary Flames that was scheduled last Thursday.
RELATED: COVID-19 sweeping through NFL, NBA, NHL, causing cancelations with record positive tests
The NHL resumed daily COVID-19 testing among players as the omicron variant of the virus spreads across the world.
About 10% of players across the league are under COVID-19 protocols and more than 20 games have been postponed so far.
Cross-border travel against Canadian clubs has also been suspended until after Christmas, leading to the Coyotes postponing its game against the Vancouver Canucks on Sunday.
Arizona’s next home game against the Tampa Bay Lightning remains on the schedule for Dec. 23.

Published Nov. 29, 2021Updated Dec. 21, 2021
There are no “good” foods and “bad” foods. Rather, it’s your overall dietary pattern that matters most when it comes to healthful eating.
That’s the main message from the American Heart Association in its latest nutrition guidance to improve the hearts and health of Americans of all ages and life circumstances.
The experts who wrote the recommendations recognize that people don’t eat nutrients or individual ingredients. They eat foods, and most people want to enjoy the foods they eat while staying within their budgets and, the association hopes, without injuring their bodies.
This doesn’t mean you need to totally avoid Big Macs, Cokes and French fries, but it does mean you should not regularly indulge in such fare if you want to stay healthy.
Dr. Robert H. Eckel, a former president of the American Heart Association, and an endocrinologist and lipid specialist at the University of Colorado Denver, told me he “occasionally” indulges in foods outside a wholesome dietary pattern. The operative word here, though, is “occasionally.”
Dr. Neil J. Stone, a preventive cardiologist at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University, who praised the thoughtfulness and expertise of the guidance committee, said in an interview, “There’s no such thing as one diet that fits all, but there are principles to form the basis of diets that fit everyone.”
He added: “The goal is to make good nutrition possible for all. The healthier we can keep everybody in this country, the lower our health costs will be.”
In the 15 years since the heart association last issued dietary guidelines to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, almost nothing has changed for the better. The typical American diet has remained highly processed. Americans consume too much added sugars, artery-clogging fats, refined starches, red meat and salt and don’t eat enough nutrient-rich vegetables, fruits, nuts, beans and whole grains that can help prevent heart disease, diabetes and cancer.
But rather than become discouraged, the association decided to try a different approach. For too long, nutrition advice has been overly focused on individual nutrients and ingredients, Alice H. Lichtenstein, the guidelines’ chief author, told me, and it hasn’t been focused enough on overall dietary patterns that can best fit people’s lives and budgets.
So instead of a laundry list of “thou shalt not eats,” Dr. Lichtenstein said, the association’s committee on nutrition and cardiovascular disease chose to promote heart-healthy dietary patterns that could suit a wide range of tastes and eating habits. In avoiding “no noes” and dietary revolutions, the new guidance can foster gradual evolutionary changes meant to last a lifetime.
The committee recognized that for people to adopt and stick to a wholesome dietary pattern, it should accommodate personal likes and dislikes, ethnic and cultural practices and life circumstances, and it should consider whether most meals are consumed at home or on the go.
For example, rather than urging people to skip pasta because it’s a refined carbohydrate, a more effective message might be to tell people to eat it the traditional Italian way, as a small first-course portion. Or, if pasta is your main course, choose a product made from an unrefined carbohydrate like whole wheat, brown rice or lentils.
“We’re talking about lifelong changes that incorporate personal preferences, culinary traditions and what’s available where people shop and eat,” said Dr. Lichtenstein, a professor of nutrition science and policy at the Friedman School at Tufts University. “The advice is evidence-based and applies to everything people eat regardless of where the food is procured, prepared and consumed.”
The guidelines’ first principle is to adjust one’s “energy intake and expenditure” to “achieve and maintain a healthy body weight,” a recommendation that may be easier to follow with the next two principles: Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, and choose foods made mostly with whole grains rather than refined grains. If cost or availability is an issue, as is the case in many of the country’s food deserts where fresh produce is scarce, Dr. Lichtenstein suggested keeping bags of frozen fruits and vegetables on hand to reduce waste, add convenience and save money.
Some wholesome protein choices that the committee recommended included fish and seafood (although not breaded and fried), legumes and nuts, and low-fat or fat-free dairy products. If meat is desired, choose lean cuts and refrain from processed meats like sausages, hot dogs and deli meats that are high in salt and saturated fat.
The committee’s advice on protein foods, published during the climate talks in Glasgow , was well-timed. Choosing plant-based proteins over animal sources of protein not only has health value for consumers but can help to foster a healthier planet.
Experts have long known that animal products like beef, lamb, pork and veal have a disproportionately negative impact on the environment. Raising animals requires more water and land and generates more greenhouse gases than growing protein-rich plants does.
“This is a win-win for individuals and our environment,” Dr. Lichtenstein said. However, she cautioned, if a plant-based diet is overloaded with refined carbohydrates and sugars, it will raise the risk of Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. And she discouraged relying on popular plant-based meat alternatives that are ultra-processed and often high in sodium, unhealthy fats and calories, and that “may not be ecologically sound to produce.”
To protect both the environment and human health, the committee advised shifting one’s diet away from tropical oils — coconut, palm and palm kernel — as well as animal fats (butter and lard) and partially hydrogenated fats (read the nutrition label). Instead, use liquid plant oils like corn, soybean, safflower, sunflower, canola, nut and olive. They have been shown to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent , an effect comparable to taking a statin drug.
As for beverages, the committee endorsed the current national dietary guideline to avoid drinks with added sugars (including honey and concentrated fruit juice). If you don’t currently drink alcohol, the committee advised against starting; for those who do drink, limit consumption to one to two drinks a day.
All told, the dietary patterns that the committee outlined can go far beyond reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases like heart attacks and strokes. They can also protect against Type 2 diabetes and a decline of kidney function, and perhaps even help foster better cognitive abilities and a slower rate of age-related cognitive decline.
The earlier in life a wholesome dietary pattern begins, the better, Dr. Lichtenstein said. “It should start preconception, not after someone has a heart attack, and reinforced through nutrition education in school, K through 12.”
And during annual checkups, Dr. Eckel said, primary care doctors should devote three to five minutes of the visit to a lifestyle interview, asking patients how many servings of fruits, vegetables and whole grains they consume and whether they read nutrition labels.

Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jen Psaki, December 20, 2021
December 20, 2021
James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
3:03 P.M. EST
MS. PSAKI: Hi everyone. Happy Monday.
Q  Happy, happy.
MS. PSAKI: Happy, happy. Okay.
One note for all of you at the top. President Biden has nominated and the Senate has confirmed the most diverse class of federal judges in history at a rate not seen since President Reagan.
As you may have seen Friday night and Saturday morning, the Senate confirmed dozens of historical and critical nominees. This included 9 district court judges, bringing the total for the year to 40 — more than any President in his first year in office since President Reagan.
But it’s not just the sheer number of people nominated and confirmed. As the President said at his commencement address last week at South Carolina State, he is proud to have appointed more Black women to the circuit courts than any administration in American history. We’ve confirmed the first LGBTQ woman ever to serve as a federal circuit court judge. And these 40 judges include people who have previously served as public defenders, labor lawyers, and civil rights lawyers, as well as prosecutors and government attorneys.
The Senate also voted to confirm 41 ambassadors to countries around the world, including critical allies such as — including Japan, France, the European Union, and more. These qualified, competent leaders can now finally get to their important work representing America’s interests abroad.
There’s still a lot of work to be done, and we’ll continue to work with the Senate to make sure we have the people in place so that we can continue to serve the American people.
Also wanted to note the Department of Justice announced today that they’ll be awarding $1.6 billion in grants to support a range of initiatives to reduce violent crime and make our communities safer.
This money will help address the surge in gun violence that we’ve seen over the last two years and will bolster steps that the administration has already taken to crack down on violent crime, including the President’s Comprehensive Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gun Crime in June.
These grants will help advance community violence intervention programs, they’ll support evidence-based police and prosecution strategies, they’ll ensure that victims of crime get the resources they need, they’ll help people returning from prisons and jails transition successfully back into their communities, and they’ll support responses to crises like drug overdoses and mental health episodes.
This is just the latest example of the historic levels of funding that President Biden has made available to cities and states to address crime, including through the Rescue Plan; through investments in proven community violence intervention strategies that we announced in April; through the COPS community policing grants announced last month, which are helping to put 1,000 more police officers on the beat across 183 police departments this year; and through earlier DOJ awards, including $1.2 billion for victim assistance and compensation programs and more.
With that — I would say that since there’s space in the back, why don’t folks who are standing sit in some of the back seats, just because I know everybody is focused on the spacing of — spacing in these days.
Go ahead, Colleen.
Q  Okay, a couple things. So, on Omicron, cases are rising dramatically across the country. Americans are still traveling en masse. Biden is giving a speech that has been labeled “urgent” that the speech is tomorrow. The Vice President also was saying that scientists were caught off guard by the variants, and then there’s been pushback from the scientific community on that.
So, can you help — just talk a little bit about what the White House’s message on Omicron is. What should the public be thinking? How — should we be concerned? What should we do?
And then the second one — I’m sorry, I’ll ask you after. Go ahead.
MS. PSAKI: Absolutely, Colleen. Well, let me first say that the President, as you noted, will be addressing the American people tomorrow, and he’ll talk about what to expect as we head into the winter months and detail additional steps that he — we will be taking.
The President has been clear that while vaccinated individuals get COVID due — he will restate tomorrow, I should say, that while vaccinated individuals get COVID due to the highly transmissible nature of Omicron, their cases will likely be mild or asymptomatic.
We continue to see and our health experts assess that you are 14 times more likely to die of COVID if you have not been vaccinated versus vaccinated.
Importantly, he’ll restate we’re prepared and that fully vaccinated individuals have the tools to protect themselves with a booster shot and masking where CDC recommends.
For those who choose to remain unvaccinated, he’ll issue a stark warning and make clear unvaccinated individuals will continue to drive hospitalizations and deaths. That is not trying to scare people — or maybe it is trying to make clear to people in the country what the risks are here of not being vaccinated.
What is clear is that we’re not in the same place that we were at — and this is something he’ll reiterate tomorrow as well — at the beginning of the pandemic thanks to the President’s extraordinary work to get over 200 million Americans vaccinated.
To be clear: COVID-19 is not the same threat to fully vaccinated individuals that it was in March 2020, and I outlined some of the reasons why. And again, as I said at the top, he will also announce additional steps.
So, he will outline this clearly tomorrow. He has been candid and he has been direct as he’s provided updates to the American public throughout on our steps to address what we know is an unpredictable virus and a once- — in our fight against a once-in-a-generation pandemic. But that’s what people can expect tomorrow.
Q  Okay. Thank you.
On the negotiations over Build Back Better, we see Senator Manchin’s version of events sort of differ from the White House’s version of events in your statement on Sunday — which, I guess, was yesterday; feels like a long time ago.
I just wanted to know if you could talk a little bit about like where the — where the gap is — if the negotiations fell apart over the Child Tax Credit issue, if the White House is prepared to go around legislation on — on the CTC if necessary. Kind of, where are we with Manchin?
MS. PSAKI: Well, I would say I think the lengthy statement that I issued yesterday outlined pretty specifically the events of the last few weeks. And it was important to the President and to all of us to make that clear to the American people — the status and the steps that had been taken.
But I’m not going to relitigate the tick-tock of yesterday from here today. I will say that, from the President’s viewpoint — and I saw him this morning — he’s worked with Senator Manchin over the course of decades. They share fundamental values, they’re longtime friends — that has not changed.
And what’s most on the President’s mind is the risk of inaction. And if we do not act to get this legislation done and the components in it, not only will costs and prices go up for the American people, but also we will see a trajectory in economic growth that is not where we want it to be. And we’ve seen projections from Goldman Sachs and others today on that front.
So, he’s no stranger to legislative challenges, and we are going to continue to take steps — work like hell to get it done.
Go ahead.
Q  Does the President feel betrayed by his friend?
MS. PSAKI: I think our statement yesterday made pretty clear what we feel — what was the factual depiction of events that happened.
But again, the President sees Senator Manchin as somebody who is a longtime friend, somebody he has worked well together on. And our objective and our focus now is moving forward.
Q  And where do lines of communication stand at this point between either the President and Joe Manchin, Joe Manchin and the White House staff that you spoke about? Is there contact at all?
MS. PSAKI: I’m just not going to assess or give you an update on specifics from here.
Q  And just quickly, on COVID: Ahead of tomorrow’s speech, should Americans expect any new restrictions?
MS. PSAKI: This is not a speech about locking the country down. This is a speech outlining and being direct and clear with the American people about the benefits of being vaccinated, the steps we’re going to take to increase access and to increase testing, and the risks posed to unvaccinated individuals.
Go ahead.
Q  Does the President still trust Senator Manchin?
MS. PSAKI: Again, I understand the questions here, but our focus is on moving forward. I think our statement yesterday made clear what the course of events were over the last couple of weeks; it was important for the American people to know and see that.
But he considers Senator Manchin a longtime friend, and our focus is on moving forward and getting this done.
Q  Are you confident that all 49 other members of the Democratic Caucus are still on board with Build Back Better, since —
MS. PSAKI: I think —
Q  — we’re looking ahead?
MS. PSAKI: Sure. I understand, Ed. I can’t, obviously, speak for all of them. But I think you saw quite a bit of unanimity yesterday in the response of people and their desire from across the Democratic Party and the desire to get this legislation done.
Q  What would be his message to progressives who he asked to hang with him as things moved over to the Senate now that what many of them warned has happened?
MS. PSAKI: Well, I would say, one, his message would be: We need to work together to get this done, and he’s going to work like hell to get it done. And that would be his message. And January is an opportunity to do exactly that.
Q  Quickly, on Ukraine —
MS. PSAKI: Yes.
Q  The State Department issued a Level 4 travel warning today, saying, “U.S. citizens should be aware of reports that Russia is planning for significant military action against Ukraine.
Jake Sullivan spoke with his Russian counterpart again today. Apparently, over at the Pentagon, they’ve just said that they’ve conducted an assessment of air defense needs in the Ukraine.
Obviously, you’ve said you’re monitoring this. Is U.S. intelligence picking up something new?
MS. PSAKI: Well, let me first say that the travel advisory for Ukraine remains a “Level 4: Do not travel” due to COVID-19. The State Department updated it to include information on Russia’s military buildup on Ukraine’s border just to provide additional information. But it has been at a Level 4.
Go ahead.
Q  So nothing new otherwise?
MS. PSAKI: Well, again, they provided — they — the State Department provides additional information through travel advisories to make sure they are being transparent with American citizens who are in different countries. And that’s exactly what they did in this case.
And we have historically seen large numbers of Americans and others, of course, traveling to Ukraine during this time of year in the holiday season, so it was just an effort to provide that information directly.
Go ahead.
Q  Jen, your statement yesterday alluded to working more on Build Back Better next year. Is your expectation that President Biden and Senator Manchin will talk at all before the end of the year?
MS. PSAKI: I’m just not going to give you any updates on their engagements from here — I wouldn’t expect. And we’re going to keep those private.
Q  Got it. And do you regard his $1.8 trillion proposal as a nonstarter given that it excludes the Child Tax Credit?
MS. PSAKI: I think the President has been clear about — and I’ll let Senator Manchin speak to the specifics of his proposal. I’m not going to confirm those details from here of what — I know I’ve seen — I know there have been reports out there, but I’ll let him speak to that.
But I would say that the President, of course, wants to extend the Child Tax Credit. That’s something he has spoken to. We know that it was a significant contributor to cutting in half the child poverty rate.
I’m obviously not going to negotiate from here. But, you know, he doesn’t think “compromise” is a dirty word either.
Q  One COVID question. On Sunday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio asked the President to invoke the Defense Production Act because of a shortage of at-home tests, monoclonal antibody treatments — and he also said that the Pfizer anti-viral pills should be fast tracked. Are any of those things under consideration at this moment?
MS. PSAKI: Well, we’re in touch — I will say first — with the City of New York and the state, as well as other — all officials across the country experiencing upticks. We’ve sent 30 ambulances to the state and an accompanying team of personnel to help balance patient loads among hospitals across the state.
We’ve already used the Defense Production Act and spent $3 billion to greatly expand the number of at-home tests. So that’s already something we have tapped into.
And as I noted earlier, the President will have more to say tomorrow in his remarks about our efforts to expand access.
Go ahead.
Q  Senator Manchin, this morning, on a radio interview said, “This is staff. And they drove some things” that they put — and they “put some things out that were absolutely inexcusable. They know what it is. And that’s it.” Do you know what he’s referring to there? And do you have a response to the — his comments about the staff?
MS. PSAKI: I don’t. I would point you to Senator Manchin to outline further.
Q  And then, can you walk through — and I know you don’t want to talk about yesterday’s statement — but the cost benefit of — you guys have been so cautious, I think at the President’s direction, of never speaking ill or laying out details of negotiations — what the calculation was by deciding to put out a 700-plus word statement being very clear about some palpable anger inside the White House related to a critical vote in the caucus?
MS. PSAKI: Well, I think Senator Manchin had a strong statement yesterday, and we had a strong statement as well. And we’re ready to move forward and get this done, and work like hell to do that with Senator Manchin, with members of the Democratic Caucus, across the Democratic Party. And that’s our focus moving forward.
But that was our basis of our calculus yesterday.
Q  And just one more quick one. My understanding is the — what Senator Manchin put on the table, which you referenced in your statement, wasn’t a final offer. It hadn’t been rejected. It was kind of a process that was underway.
What is the process now? Are you working through proposals? Is staff dealing with policy issues? Where do things go from here in terms of the actual proposal?
MS. PSAKI: Well, clearly, the next couple of weeks will be important and pivotal and certainly involve high-level staff engagements, enga- — involve the President and his engagements directly with members. And we have been engaged with leadership, with members of the Senate and their staff over the course of the 24 — the last 24 hours to talk about the path forward.
You saw, I’m sure, Leader Schumer’s statement this morning, and we will stay in close touch and in close coordination with him and his team on the path forward in January.
Go ahead.
Q  So, two — one on COVID and one on —
MS. PSAKI: Sure.
Q  — on Build Back Better.
On COVID, has there been an outbreak of COVID at the White House, the NSC, the State Department, and the Treasury? And has the President been in contact — close contact with a COVID-positive person and thus in need of quarantine?
MS. PSAKI: The President has a full schedule today and is not in need of quarantine. We will provide information to all of you, as outlined with our commitment from just a few months ago about being transparent about close contacts. I don’t have any updates for you at this mo- — point in time.
But, again, we expect there to be breakthrough cases across the country — right? — and certainly in the federal government. And the most important thing to note for you and for others is that the — 99 percent of the — of the — or more, at this point, of the White House staff is vaccinated. Boosters are strongly recommended and distributed. We have a very thorough process here that people abide by who are going to have close contact with the President — and even beyond that. And those protocols go above and beyond CDC guidelines.
Q  But you’re going to say whether or not there’s been a significant outbreak in the various different parts that I mentioned: NSC, State Department, Treasury?
MS. PSAKI: Again, I point you to different agencies to give any additional information. But I would just note that we do expect there to be breakthrough cases, as there are — as there will be across government.
Q  Okay. And then on Build Back Better: Did you see the Steve Clemons article today blaming the White House for “incivility” toward Senator Manchin — and specifically, the statement that was released on Thursday — I think, Thursday evening — in which this — the read or the assessment was that the senator thought that that statement blamed him in a — in a way that wasn’t in keeping with the approach that he and the President had been dealing?
MS. PSAKI: I have not yet read his article. It’s been a busy day. But I will tell you that our intention — I think, if you look back to last Thursday — was to provide an update on the future of Build Back Better. And I think it is not a secret where there was opposition to Build Back Better moving forward and where there is support, which is the vast majority of the Democratic Caucus. That was not intended to be directive or hurtful, but to state — be a statement of fact.
Go ahead.
Q  Yeah, thank you, Jen. In a press call this afternoon, Representative Jayapal, Chairwoman of the House Progressive Caucus, called on President Biden to pursue executive action to pass components of the Build Back Better legislation. Is this something that the White House would consider or even thinks is a realistic possibility to pass some of these elements?
MS. PSAKI: Well, I haven’t had a chance to discuss Representative Jayapal’s call with our legislative team. I’m not aware of that being under discussion. Obviously, we have used executive authority and executive action for a range of steps to make a range of progress, and the President has not hesitated to do that.
The benefit of legislation is, obviously, it makes it permanent. So, there’s a lot of value in that.
But I can see if that’s something more under active consideration.
Q  And real quick: Regarding communications with Senator Manchin, you’ve not said much on that. I mean, are you able to confirm that — whether or not President Biden has reached out to the senator today?
MS. PSAKI: I’m not going to detail contacts further.
Go ahead.
Q  Jen, thanks. Just to drill down a little bit on that: Moving forward, you’ve already taken Senator Manchin to the woodshed. Are you going to invite him back into the fold? Are you going to try to reach out to him?
MS. PSAKI: Of course. And we conveyed, yesterday, that.
Q  And secondly —
MS. PSAKI: And I would also note the — the last sentence of my — two sentences of the statement was: “But we will not relent in the fight to help Americans with their child care, health care, prescription drug costs, and elder care…The fight for Build Back Better is too important to give up. We will find a way to move forward next year.”
It also made clear that we absolutely want to work with Senator Manchin and all Democrats to get this done.
Q  And are you going to work with to bring — try to bring GOP members into the fold?
MS. PSAKI: We would certainly welcome their efforts or — whether their — their support for lowering cost for the American people and driving up economic growth. We would.
Q  And then a follow-up, if I may, on COVID. You said 14 times more likely to die — unvaccinated. Is there a point in time where this administration — I mean, what you said recently about, “Hey, for those who are vaccinated, it’s mild or asymptomatic. For those who are not, death and destruction awaits you.” So, are you pretty much done trying to be diplomatic on this? Is it over with?
MS. PSAKI: I think our responsibility and the President’s responsibility is to continue to convey the risks, to continue — continue — excuse me — to make sure we are increasing access for vaccines, access to information to the public, and that’s what you’ll hear him talk about tomorrow.
Go ahead, Jacqui.
Q Thanks, Jen. Did the White House share the Thursday statement with Senator Manchin before it was put out? And what was his reaction to that?
MS. PSAKI: I’m not going to detail private discussions or private sharing of statements in advance.
Q  Okay. And then, on his call-out to Democrats for badgering him, saying that they believe that he could be moved in his position somehow: Is there any regret within the White House or within discussions with Democratic leadership just about how this negotiation went, given that statement from him? And he feels that he’s been badgered and beaten.
MS. PSAKI: Well, that certainly is not our objective, never has been our objective. But our objective is getting this legislation passed and reminding the American people and all people who could vote for it what the stakes are.
So, no, we don’t have regrets about aggressively communicating about it and making sure people understand that if we don’t pass this legislation, costs for the American people will go up and economic growth projections will not go in the right direction.
Q  This shows, though, that Democrats just don’t have a large enough majority to call off this kind of transformational legislation without these kinds of significant bumps in the road. But the President, you know, ran as a moderate. Joe Biden is asking for any major policy changes — or excuse me, Manchin is asking for major policy changes to be bipartisan. So why are Biden and Manchin seemingly so far apart on this, where Manchin is wanting to bring Republicans in and the President has, you know, tried to work this out just within the Democrats?
MS. PSAKI: The President would welcome Republicans joining this effort to lower the cost of childcare, to make sure that families aren’t paying thousands of dollars for insulin, to make sure people can afford care for their parents and loved ones. He would welcome that.
I think it’s not a secret that opposition is driven by the concern by many in the Republican Party that they don’t want to raise taxes on corporations and highest income. That’s not a secret. But certainly, we’d welcome support or engagement from any Republicans in this effort to get this done.
Q  And then on Omicron and the announcements coming tomorrow, one of the items that you guys have consistently said is on the table and is being evaluated is vaccine mandates for domestic air travel. Is that something that you guys have reached a decision on?
MS. PSAKI: I don’t have anything new on that. I think we’ve said in the past that masking is something we know is effective and works. I would expect, tomorrow, you’ll hear more from the President on what we’re going to do more about making vaccines and testing accessible, and what the American people can expect over the next couple of months.
Q  And real quick, on this ruling from the Sixth Circuit —
MS. PSAKI: Yeah.
Q  — on the vaccine-or-test mandate. Obviously, this has been, you know, a bit of back-and-forth between the different circuits, and it’s still caught up in the, you know, whole process. I understand that the White House has consistently said, you know, “Look to this deadline. We’re going to continue pushing toward it.”
But you’re having some businesses — like, you know, Amtrak, last week, just said that they’re going to have to cut service, and then a few days later said, “Just kidding, we’re not going to.” This, obviously, might change that calculus again. So, what’s the message —
MS. PSAKI: Well, Amtrak didn’t say that it was related to a vaccine mandate. They said it — they gave other reasons for it.
Q  I think they (inaudible).
MS. PSAKI: And also, they had 94 percent or higher percentage of their employees vaccinated.
Q  They did, but they also said on the Hill, in the hearing, that because they would need to hire qualified employees who met their vaccine requirements, that they anticipated having to cut service from, I think, January to March. And I know what you’re referring to — where they listed off some other concerns. I think it was related to hiring that was paused during the height of the pandemic. But —
MS. PSAKI: Yeah, they talked about a range of challenges they were having. But also, I would note that 94 percent — if not higher at this point — of Amtrak employees are vaccinated. We also know that 60 percent of businesses — if not higher at this point — have put in place vaccine requirements or testing requirements because they know it’s effective for the economy and it creates a safe workplace.
So, we are — certainly welcome the Sixth Circuit’s decision. We feel that the vaccination-or-testing rules will ensure businesses enact measures that protect employees, create more certainty to the — for the economy. And we don’t feel that this is a time for organizations to be backing away from these requirements.
Q  You don’t feel that this is a sort of back-and-forth, like businesses are getting whiplash, that customers are getting whiplash from announcements like this?
MS. PSAKI: I think what’s clear is that if you have the vast majority of companies in this country putting in place restrictions and requirements — testing requirements — that it’s an indication that this creates certainty in the workplace, creates — ensures there’s a healthy workplace. And that is outside of this OSHA requirement.
Go ahead.
Q  Jen, the President’s own medical advisors have suggested that if people are going to gather with family this holiday, that they try to do an at-home rapid test beforehand. But we’re seeing such a lack of the supply at so many different stores. There are very long lines all across the Northeast.
So, what is the White House doing specifically right now to help Americans get access to these tests? And will the President speak to the frustration on that front many are feeling during his remarks tomorrow?
MS. PSAKI: Absolutely he will. I would note that, to date — and we’ve always said this would always be a building process — our objective is to make tests accessible and free for Americans. There are a lot of ways to do that, and there are different ways that Americans are getting access to tests.
If you have health insurance, you can go to your doctor. If you — everyone does not have health insurance; 150 million Americans obviously do. We’ve also made 50 million tests recently available to community health centers and rural health sites. There are 20,000 free testing sites across the country. And we are going to continue to build on that, and the President will talk about that tomorrow.
Q  Does the White House feel like, right now, the administration is doing enough to get Americans access to these tests?
MS. PSAKI: We always feel we need to be doing more, and that’s what the President will talk about tomorrow.
Q  And just some quick housekeeping items. Given this surge and this spike right now from the variant, how often is the President being tested for COVID? And when was he last tested?
MS. PSAKI: He is regularly tested. I will get — I will check for you when the last time he was tested.
Q  And are there any other protocols on campus right now that are changing to accommodate? For instance, you talked about breakthrough cases. That’s something you would expect that would be in fully vaccinated people. Are these staffers who also have been boosted? And is it the White House policy that if you’re working on campus or in close proximity with the President, that you have a booster or a third dose?
MS. PSAKI: Our policy — it is heavily recommended to get a booster. If you are going to be in close proximity with the President, you’re required to be tested that day. That goes over and above typical protocols. Given the workplace we work in, that certainly is appropriate. But — and, of course, we have masking requirements that are in place as well.
So there hasn’t been a change. Obviously, we will continue to consult with our health and medical experts if any changes need to be put into place.
Q  And are there any changes right now to the holiday receptions that were already altered that are open to some members of the public here at the White House? Or —
MS. PSAKI: The open houses?
Q  Yes.
MS. PSAKI: There are — individuals who are attending those are required to be tested in advance.
Q  And any changes to the President’s holiday plans at this time, given the spike?
MS. PSAKI: Not at this time.
Go ahead.
Q  Thanks, Jen. Back on Build Back Better, just curious: What was the reaction among senior staffers here when Joe Manchin said that the President’s aides alienated him and that’s the real reason that he backed away from the bill?
MS. PSAKI: I think our statement yesterday speaks for itself.
Q  But Joe Manchin said that that statement was a — an example of retaliation by the White House. What’s your response to that?
MS. PSAKI: The statement was a statement of facts of the events of what happened over the last few weeks, and it was simply an effort to make that clear to the American people.
Q  What does this episode teach the White House about the prospects of voting rights? Joe Manchin has also said that he wants that to be a bipartisan effort. Is it going to become law by the time that this Congress is out?
MS. PSAKI: Well, that is certainly our objective. And you saw, I think, in Leader Schumer’s “Dear Colleague” that he put out this morning, that he plans to bring voting rights up when they get back — when the Senate gets back in January. And we certainly support that, and we’ll stay in close coordination with him and his team to get that done.
Go ahead.
Q  Jen, in terms of the climate provisions in Build Back Better, does the President think that he can achieve the goals that he set out to reach by 2030 without legislation? And as a result of this, is the administration looking at additional executive actions that could be taken on climate to try to meet some of those goals?
MS. PSAKI: We’re always looking at additional steps we can take. That has not changed.
As you know, I think there are multiple paths to reaching the President’s climate goals. We have every intention of passing Build Back Better, which includes enormous climate provisions. I would note that there are a number of steps we have taken without legislation, and certainly, we’ll continue to build on that, including setting a bold target to cut greenhouse gas pollution in America 50 to 52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030; tackling super-pollutants; phasing down HFCs and addressing methane leaks; rallying the world to focus on methane in Glasgow.
We stood with autoworkers and America’s big car manufacturers to roll out plans to boost electric vehicles and create opportunities to save car owners money.
We put America on track for one of every two cars sold to be zero emissions within the decade. And we jump started offshore wind.
I share all that because that has been done without the benefit — the vast majority of it — of legislation.
There are also components in the infrastructure package and law that will also help take steps forward, including the largest investment in passenger rail; helping reduce GHG emissions; building a national network of EV chargers; electrifying thousands of EV school buses; investments in port and airport infrastructure to repair, maintain, and reduce congestion; largest investment in resilience; replacing America’s lead pipes and service lines; and the largest investment in tackling legacy pollution.
So, I would say we are — it is clear from the President’s accomplishments and agenda to date that climate and the climate crisis is going to continue to be front and center for him.
We’re absolutely going to — working to get Build Back Better done. And we are not going to wait to continue to look at a range of options.
Q  And just one on schools. Prince George’s County, nearby, is going to virtual learning through mid-January. Does the administration have a view on whether local districts should revert to virtual learning, you know, in the next few months as the Omicron variant progresses?
MS. PSAKI: We continue to believe that local school districts will need to make the decisions that they feel are appropriate for their communities.
Our objective and the President’s objective is to keep schools open, and 99 percent of them are open, have been open. And we believe we have the tools to do that.
One of the steps we’ve talked about a little bit is “test to stay,” which is a proposal that’s been out there by a number of health officials where if your kid is in school now — and you probably know this, and I know this — and they have a close contact, typically they have to quarantine or be out of school.
And there have been health experts who have recommended that there can be a contact tracing and testing regimen that can allow kids to stay in school. And that is very intriguing to the President. And that is what our focus is on.
Go ahead.
Q  Can I ask, with regards to the speech tomorrow, whether the President has spoken with his health advisors at the CDC about whether they need to change their guidance on Omicron? Will this be part of the speech, in particular?
For instance, right now, we’re seeing a lot of breakthrough cases right now with vaccinated people if they’re not boosted. But the guidance right now says you don’t have to isolate if you’ve been exposed, if you’re fully vaccinated. Should that change? Should the 10-day timelines change? Do we need to, like, pretty substantially overhaul these guidances — guidance for the Omicron variant, given how fast it seems to replicate?
MS. PSAKI: Look, I think the President’s view is that if that is the guidance and the belief of his health and medical experts, who he engages with and is briefed by regularly, then he is looking to them for that guidance.
As you know, they haven’t changed that guidance to date. But given the spread of Omicron, given the transmissibility of Omicron, of course, they’re continuing to look at a range of steps.
Q  But we don’t expect that to be part of tomorrow’s speech (inaudible)?
MS. PSAKI: I don’t have anything more to preview for you. But, again, the focus of the President’s speech tomorrow is providing expectations to the American people of what they can look ahead to over the next couple of months and an understanding — and an update on what he and his administration are going to do more.
Q  Is the baseline expectation for the President right now that cases are going to continue to rise? Francis Collins retired and warned on the way out that we could see a fairly substantial rise in cases, like hundreds and hundreds of thousands of cases a day.
MS. PSAKI: And I think Dr. Fauci has referred — has discussed that as well. As you know, Josh, I think some of it depends — as they have both, I believe, spoken to — on the steps taken by people in this country to get vaccinated, to take necessary precautions.
But certainly, we continue to believe that based on health — based on science, that the boosters can protect people, can prevent hospitalization and death. And that’s why we are going to continue to echo that out to the public.
Q  And sorry, forgive me — I know you —
MS. PSAKI: Go ahead.
Q  — don’t want to — I know you don’t want —
MS. PSAKI: You’re fine.
Q  — bark too much up the tree of what happened in —
MS. PSAKI: Federal Reserve —
Q  — in the last 24 hours —
MS. PSAKI: — or something else?
Q  Yeah. No, no, no. (Laughter.) I’ll be back tomorrow.
MS. PSAKI: Okay. (Laughter.)
Q  The President, of course, spoke with Senator Manchin many times. Senator Manchin seems to be, essentially, blaming the White House, right? He’s referring to comments made by — or staff — or actions taken by the President’s staff. He hasn’t necessarily specified what those are; they’re indications that it’s perhaps the statement from Thursday.
Do you think that there was a misstep on the part of the administration here? Because it feels like if you can’t sort out what ticked him off, then it’s sort of difficult to imagine a path forward on whatever efforts to salvage this will be undertaken in the next weeks and months.
MS. PSAKI: Well, look, I can’t speak for Senator Manchin on what has upset him. I’ll let him speak to that himself with more specifics if he — if he chooses to, and he may or may not choose to, and that’s his prerogative.
All I can convey is that, you know, we continue to focus on how we’re going to get this done. The door remains open; the President considers him a longtime friend, someone he’s worked with on a range of initiatives and objectives over the course of the last several years that they’ve known each other. And that’s really where we’re coming at this from.
Go ahead.
Q  Thanks, Jen. Earlier — I wanted to ask: Is the President’s speech — will it also talk about life with COVID, beyond a few months?
The President talked in the past about ending COVID, but experts certainly seem to say that COVID may be here to stay much longer than that. Does the President share those views? And will that be discussed tomorrow in any way?
MS. PSAKI: Again, we’re still finalizing the speech, so I can only really give you a preview of what we know to date, which is what I’ve already outlined here. I understand that certainly is a question out there on what it looks like, and we will continue to consult with our health and medical experts on that.
Q  Does the President still feel like COVID can be ended?
MS. PSAKI: His objective is to continue — continue to make vaccines available, reduce cases around the co- — reduce hospitalizations and deaths across the country, and do that through making vaccines, testing, and a range of utilities available.
Q  On tests: You talked about the Defense Production Act being used to boost tests —
MS. PSAKI: Yeah.
Q  — and that there is going to be some conversation tomorrow about increasing use of — increasing availability of tests. Should we expect an announcement about the DPA being used to help bring more tests to the country?
MS. PSAKI: We’re already using the DPA, so that’s already happening. But I’m not going to get ahead more of the President’s — I know he’s been meeting with his COVID team while I’ve been out here, so I can’t — there’s not much more I can preview at this point in time.
Go ahead.
Q  Thank you, Jen. I’ve got a question about Build Back Better and then a question about the coronavirus.
MS. PSAKI: Sure.
Q  On Build Back Better — returning to Josh and Phil’s questions about Senator Manchin blaming White House staff: Steve Ricchetti was reportedly a top liaison with Senator Manchin. Is Mr. Ricchetti or any other West Wing staff being reassigned as a result of Senator Manchin’s complaints?
MS. PSAKI: No. And Senator Manchin hasn’t even outlined more detail.
Q  Okay. And on the coronavirus: Last week, I asked President Biden, on the Lawn, about 800,000 American deaths. When I asked him why he hadn’t done more to press China to be transparent on the origins of the pandemic, he smiled and walked away without giving a verbal answer. I’m wondering why was that his reaction. And can you give us an update on anything he has done to press China for transparency, especially to ensure that there isn’t another pandemic?
MS. PSAKI: Well, we put out an extensive statement from the President on the 800,000 deaths, which I’m sure many of you noted.
And again, I would just reiterate — what we’ve said many times is that we are going to continue to press China to be more transparent, to participate in the global community’s effort to push them to do more to get to the origins of the virus.
As you know, we’ve also tapped into all of the resources we have here through our intelligence community, through working with our partners and allies, and we will continue to press to do that.
Go ahead.
Q  Does the administration regret the earlier guidance on booster shots where not everyone was eligible and they weren’t made to look like they were an essential part of protecting people from the pandemic?
MS. PSAKI: That was a decision made by our health and medical experts, so I would point you to them.
Go ahead.
Q  Yeah. Hi, Jen. Does the administration have any plans to lift the travel ban on several Southern African countries, given the fact that Omicron is clearly already here and is kind of spreading pretty rapidly?
MS. PSAKI: I mean, our objective is to not — this is not a permanent ban at all; it is temporary. And we are continuing to assess day to day the decision to lift that ban. But, yes, that is our intention to lift the ban.
Q  Okay, got it. And then also —
MS. PSAKI: And I don’t have a timeline on that at this point in time, to conclude my answer there.
Go ahead.
Q  Okay. And then second question for you, just because — a follow-up on the vaccine mandates for large employers: Those guidelines currently don’t include anything about booster shots. Is there going to be any sort of update to those requirements that will include further guidance on, you know, whether boosters will be included as like a — as a requirement towards being fully vaccinated, essentially?
MS. PSAKI: Sure, it’s a good question. So, we would — first, the CDC has not changed their evaluation of what being “fully vaccinated” means. I think Dr. Fauci has said it’s not a matter of “if” but “when.” And then, obviously, we base any of our policies from the federal government on the CDC guidance.
So, that would be the first step if and when they were to change that.
Go ahead.
Q  Can you bring us up to speed — I just have two questions: one on Russia, one on Afghanistan.
Can you bring us up to speed on conversations between the White House and the Kremlin over the weekend?
MS. PSAKI: Sure.
Q  And can you clarify the administration’s stance on some of the specific demands that Russia made? For example, most importantly, the one that Ukraine not be allowed to join NATO.
MS. PSAKI: Sure. Well, let me first say — I know we put out a readout, I believe, of — or if not, it will be coming soon. But: “Today, Jake Sullivan spoke with…” Yuri Shakov [sic] — Ushokov [sic] — Ushakov — I’m sure I’m butchering his last name, apologies — “…Foreign Policy Advisor to President Vladimir Putin of Russia. He indicated U.S. readiness to engage in diplomacy through multiple channels, including bilateral engagement, the NATO-Russia Council, and the OSCE. He made clear that any dialogue must be based on reciprocity and address our concerns about Russia’s actions, and take place in full coordination with our European Allies and partners.”
That is consistent with our ongoing outreach and engagement with the Russians, with the Ukrainians, with the Europeans as well that happened through the course of last week.
As it relates to NATO membership or joining NATO, as — as we’ve talk- — said many times but I’ll just reiterate, given I know it was raised through their proposal: The President’s view, the administration’s view is that the right of sovereign nations to choose their partnerships and alliances is a core principle of European security and has been agreed to and reaffirmed many times over the years. This remains U.S. policy today, mean- — it is — we support the aspirations of countries to join NATO and meet specific requirements.
It — NATO’s relationship with Ukraine is a matter only for Ukraine and 30 NATO Allies to determine.
Q  Thank you. And then on Afghanistan: What’s the administration’s take on this letter from 46 members of Congress asking the Treasury to unfreeze or ease Afghanistan’s access to foreign reserves, and to do more to allow financial institutions and aid groups to operate in Afghanistan?
MS. PSAKI: Well, there are a number of reasons why the Afghan reserves remain inaccessible, including, first and most immediate, the status of the funds is the subject of ongoing litigation brought by certain victims of 9/11 and other terrorist attacks who hold judgments against the Taliban. And these letal [sic] — legal proceedings obviously cannot be disregarded.
We also — the second reason is, we continue to face difficult fundamental questions about how it might be — we might be able to make reserve funds available to directly benefit the people of Afghanistan while ensuring that the funds do not benefit the Taliban.
And finally, the Taliban remains sanctioned by the United States as a “specially designated global terrorist group.” That certainly has not changed. 
But this is, of course, complicated by the ongoing litigation over those funds.
Go ahead. Hello.
Q  Thanks, Jen. Does the President think Senator Biden is — Senator Biden — Senator Manchin is going to —
MS. PSAKI: He always thinks of himself as a senator. (Laughter.)
Q  Does the President think Senator Manchin —
MS. PSAKI: There you go. You’re not wrong.  
Q  Does the President think Senator Manchin has been negotiating in good faith?
MS. PSAKI: He has said that from the beginning. He continues to consider him a friend. And, obviously, our statement yesterday over — about the events of the last few weeks, I think, speaks for itself.
Q  The reason I ask is that some progressives are alleging — alleging that Manchin was always going to be a no and, in effect, bamboozled the White House into believing that he was negotiating in good faith and was going to pull the plug at the end of the process.
MS. PSAKI: Well, look, I know there’s a lot of theorizing out there; we certainly understand that. But the fact remains that we only have 50 votes in the Senate — that has not changed. You need all of those members to support legislation moving forward.
And I know one of the arguments out there is that we should have waited on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill. Look, the President has said from the beginning and continues to believe today — and is committed to today to getting both done — obviously, the Infrastructure bill is now law — to getting Build Back Better done.
But if the question is whether we should have delayed and not moved forward with replacing lead pipes for millions of communities — of people in communities across the country, we disagree with that.
Or if you’re — the argument is that we should have waited and delayed replacing broadband, we disagree with that.
And if you believe that we should have delayed in putting many, many union workers to work, creating many, many good-paying union jobs, we disagree with that. We’re going to get both done.
And we certainly understand there’s a lot of theorizing about what happened or what’s going to happen moving forward.
Go ahead, in the middle.
Q  Thanks — thank you, Jen.
Q  Thanks, Jen.
Q  I want to ask you — I’m sorry.
MS. PSAKI: We can go to both.
Go ahead.
Q  Oh, thank you so much. I want to ask you about that statement that you put out yesterday.
MS. PSAKI: Sure.
Q  Very harsh statement. It’s very rare that I see a President, through a statement, criticizing a member of his own party in the manner in which that statement was written. And I want to ask you as to whether or not you believe that harsh rhetoric coming from the White House, the harsh rhetoric that I’ve seen coming from fellow Democrats, progressives in particular, may push Senator Manchin out of the Democratic Party.
MS. PSAKI: Senator Manchin has spoken to that. And the President continues to believe that they share a range of values. They share a commitment to helping working people, to helping lower costs for the American people.
Our intention yesterday was to provide specific details to the American people about the events of the last few weeks.
And our statement followed a statement by Senator Manchin.
Q  The other thing I wanted to ask you about are the comments of Senator Manchin. Over the course of the past several months, the comments that I’ve paid a lot of attention to — you have as well; the op-eds that he’s written for both the Washington Post and his hometown newspapers; the interviews that he’s done with a West Virginia radio host named Hoppy Kercheval — all of them, from my perspective, seemed to indicate that he was not going to support the Build Back Better bill. And yet, your statement indicated utter surprise, in terms of the statement that he made on Fox News yesterday. Why were you so surprised?
MS. PSAKI: Well, I think, as my statement very clearly outlined, because there were private conversations and private discussions and commitments made. And so that’s why we were surprised.
Go ahead, in the middle. Sorry, go ahead.
Q  Thanks, Jen. So, given the current state of the pandemic, does the President anticipate giving an in-person State of the Union next year, or where are you on those conversations?
MS. PSAKI: Nothing has changed about our intentions or our plans, but we don’t yet have a date set at this point in time.
Go ahead.
Q  Thank you so much, Jen. Due to the difficulties around testing, do you think public health officials in the United States are getting a correct picture of how Omicron is spreading today in the country?
MS. PSAKI: That’s a very good question. I mean, I would say that, you know, the President — and obviously, as I said, in response to Monica’s question earlier, you’ll hear the President talk tomorrow about his commitment to continuing to expand access to free testing for the American people.
We have taken a lot of steps over the last few weeks and months: We’ve quadrupled our testing capacity over just a few months.
But really, I think that’s a good question — a very good question that I think you could ask — you should ask the health and medical experts and team at the next COVID briefing.
Go ahead, Shelby.
Q  Thanks, Jen. I wanted to ask a follow-up on the COVID testing.
MS. PSAKI: Sure.
Q  I know you’ve detailed what the administration is doing already to ease some of these problems, but we’re obviously still seeing them across the country. So, is there anything new that the administration is considering to ease some of these COVID testing issues?
And then, more broadly, you know, how are we in a position, nearly two years into a pandemic, where we’re still dealing with issues like a lack of access to testing?
MS. PSAKI: Well, I think, Shelby, on the first, we’re dealing with a once-in-a-lifetime global pandemic that has been very unpredictable, and I think everybody would acknowledge that. And what we’ve done on testing is to continue to increase access, make it affordable and accessible. That’s important morally; it’s important substantively and policy-wise to the President.
Obviously, there weren’t any [at-home] COVID tests available
or approved by the FDA
earlier this year, so now there’s eight. And we’ve taken steps to quadruple our testing capacity over just the last couple of months. And we’ve also taken steps to make them widely available at — by sending 50 million to rural health clinics and community health centers, making sure there are 20,000 pharmacy locations across the country.
But, obviously, with the transmissibility of this variant, we’re going to continue to build on that. And that’s what I think the people — the American people will hear from him on tomorrow.
Q  Thank you, Jen. I have two foreign policy questions.
MS. PSAKI: Sure.
Q  You have seen the review that indicated the killing of 1,300 civilians in the Middle East since 2014 by drones. I know there was successive administrations, not just the Biden administration. It gives reasons like “fluid intelligence” and “faulty targeting” and “little accountability.”
Since the President (inaudible) on these drone attacks, does that mean that the White House is looking into reviewing the decision itself, in parallel to what the Pentagon is doing? And I have another question.
MS. PSAKI: Yeah, that’s a great question. I know the Pentagon is doing a review, as you noted, and I would certainly point you to them. I can certainly talk to our national security team and see if there’s anything in addition. Obviously, the Pentagon is part of the administration, as you well know. But I will see if there’s anything in addition.
Q  Okay, great. And on Iran — the Iranians said that they’re not going back to the talks. Does that mean that economic sanction is inevitable now? Do you still hope that there’s another round before the end of the year?
MS. PSAKI: Yeah, another great question, Nadia. I mean, as we’ve said: Because of the way that the Iranians approached and participated in the last round of talks, we — the President — we did take a num- — asked us — the national security team — to be prepared in the event that diplomacy fails and to take a look at other options. And that has been work that has been ongoing, including in consultation with a range of partners around the world.
In terms of what next steps — it looks like, I don’t think I have anything at this point to preview for you.
Go ahead.
Q  Rahm Emanuel was just approved as ambassador to Japan. And following Afghanistan — Japan hosts 50,000 American troops, the largest in the world. There’s a concern as to the ongoing trust of the Security Treaty. So, can you — a little bit of assurance to the Japanese people that our treaty will be honored?
And then also, a follow-up on Afghanistan.
MS. PSAKI: I’m not aware of any planned changes.
Q  And then, on Afghanistan — the situation for the people that worked with us: Any progress on bringing them back?
MS. PSAKI: Well, we have put out updates over the course — and I would really point you to the State Department — and reiterate that our efforts have continued — to continue to bring American citizens out of Afghanistan who wish to depart and have wished to depart since August, as well as our allies and partners. That’s why we’ve been working so closely in coordination and cooperation with the Qataris. But the State Department really oversees that effort, so they would have any up-to-date numbers for you.
I can do one or two more. Why don’t we go all the way to the back? Go to the middle. Go ahead.
Q  Thank you, Jen. Two questions — one on politics and one on foreign policy.
MS. PSAKI: Yeah.
Q  Today, two Democratic members of the House of Representatives — Representatives Murphy of New Jersey and Sires — Murphy of Florida and Sires of New Jersey — both announced their retirement, bringing to 22 the number of Democrats leaving the House for one reason or another. Is this something the President talks about? And does he have an opinion on the exodus of members of his own party?
MS. PSAKI: I have learned my lesson in not talking too much about politics from here. But it is true that there are retirements. That happens typically every cycle. The President, as the leader of the party, obviously, I’m sure, will be out there next year. We’ll have more to preview for you for that — on that when it’s an appropriate time.
But I would note that as it relates to the Democratic agenda and what people are going to be talking about out there, we’d rather it be us than them and have an agenda to talk about and an agenda that is about putting — creating millions of good-paying union jobs; an agenda that’s about ensuring we are, you know, lowering the costs of childcare, healthcare, eldercare; an agenda to address the climate crisis. And that’s what you’ll hear people talk about next year. But I’ll leave the politics out of the podium.
Q  Turning to Ukraine —
MS. PSAKI: Yeah.
Q  — the — President Zelenskyy has charged that the wealthiest man in Ukraine, Rinat Akhmetov, is part of a Russian plot to overthrow him. Is the U.S. considering Magnitsky-style targeted sanctions against Mr. Akhmetov?
MS. PSAKI: I don’t have anything in terms of considerations of sanctions to preview for you. Obviously, we are considering a range of sanctions as we’re looking at the buildup of Russian troops and bellicose rhetoric. But beyond that, I don’t have anything to preview.
Let’s go — just Ebony in the middle, and we’ll — then we’ll wrap it up.
Q  Thank you. Just two quick questions. I know that the White House has said in the past that they’re — don’t want to go back to a shutdown. But with the increase of —
MS. PSAKI: Yeah. And we have no intention to.
Q  Okay. Because I was going to ask, with the increase of Omicron —
MS. PSAKI: Great.
Q  — are we going to see that.
The second question is: This morning, Representative Ocasio-Cortez said that the President hasn’t used the full extent of this presidency, kind of echoing what many activists on the ground are saying. What is the response to that in terms of — she’s talking about Build Back Better and also voting rights. What’s the response to what she said?
MS. PSAKI: I didn’t — well, let me say first, on your first question, which is a very good one: I think the reason we’re not going back to a shutdown is because we are now at a very different place we are in — we were in a year ago, which is important for people. And you’ll hear the President talk about this tomorrow. Two hundred million Americans are vaccinated now. That is a stark difference from where we were a year ago. You’ll hear the President again talk more about that.
I did not see the full context of the congresswoman’s comments, but what I would say is that if you — as we look back to the last year, what we know we have accomplished to date is — working with her and a number of members — is getting the American Rescue Plan done, a step that helped put in place — extend and increase the size of the Child Tax Credit, cutting in half child poverty in this country; making sure we could keep 99 percent of schools open in this country.
We also passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill — something that, again, will make sure that we’re replacing lead pipes across the country; make sure we’re expanding access to broadband and creating tens of millions — or not tens of millions — let me remedy that — millions of good-paying union jobs. And we’ve also vaccinated 200 million Americans.
Is there more work to do? Absolutely. Of course, there is. We’re not even a year into the President’s presidency. And voting rights is front and center at the agenda — on the agenda next year. You heard Leader Schumer say that. The President reiterated that, I think in his speech at South Carolina State. And we’ll look forward to continuing to work with the congresswoman and others to get things done.
All right. Thanks, everyone.
MS. PSAKI: We’ll do this again. Merry Christmas Week.
Q  Might we hear directly from the President about what happened yesterday, this week?
MS. PSAKI: I think you will hear from him on how we’re going to get the agenda done.
Q  Will he take questions on it?
MS. PSAKI: He takes questions multiple times a week. So, depends on what you ask.
Q  From here? This room?
MS. PSAKI: Depends on what you ask.

NEW YORK (AP) —
Kyrie Irving’s return to the Brooklyn Nets is starting with a trip to the NBA’s health and safety protocols — and Kevin Durant is joining him.
The Nets’ outbreak worsened Saturday when they announced both stars were in protocols, giving them a league-high 10 players on the injury report for that reason.
“These are unforeseen circumstances and I hate to say it, it’s almost like we’ve gone back to six months, a year ago unfortunately with the cases rising,” Nets general manager Sean Marks said.
Durant already was scheduled for a night off to rest Saturday against Orlando on the opening night of a back-to-back. Instead, he became ineligible to play anyway when he was added to the injury report.
The Nets decided Friday that Irving would rejoin them for practices and road games, though he remains ineligible to play at home because he hasn’t met New York City’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for athletes playing in the city’s public venues.
The Nets determined before the season that Irving wouldn’t be a part-time player and wouldn’t be with the team unless he could play in all their games. But concerned with the heavy burden Durant has faced — his 37 minutes per game are second in the league — and needing to add a body while they keep losing them, they said the point guard would be back.
“Several months ago we made a decision that was based around what was best for the team,” Marks said. “What was best for the team at that point was continuity and I think we all see that continuity right now over the course of the last week and whatever the future looks like maybe out the window for a while, and we’ve got to navigate that as best we can.”
Irving first needed to get tested to be cleared to play and apparently he either tested positive or had an inconclusive result. The Nets also acknowledged the risk of bringing Irving back at this time, with Marks saying he hadn’t spoken to him about whether he intended to get vaccinated.
“There’s also a risk for Kyrie when a guy comes in and if they’re not vaccinated,” Marks said. “I don’t want to get into those type of discussions but that’s a risk for him coming into this environment, not just the team and so forth. But we’re all well aware of the status and his status and moving forward and how we’ll navigate this as best we can.”
James Harden, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeAndre’ Bembry, Bruce Brown, Jevon Carter, Paul Millsap, James Johnson and rookie Day’Ron Sharpe all are listed as out because of the protocols.
Needing to have eight players to start a game, the Nets scrapped their plan to rest Patty Mills and said he would be available. They also signed swingman James Ennis III and guard Shaquille Harrison to 10-day contracts.
Elsewhere, Chicago previously had 10 players in health and safety protocols, causing two of their games this week to be postponed. Three of them were cleared as of Friday, putting the Bulls on track to resume Sunday against the Lakers.
Brooklyn’s woes make Orlando’s seem minor. The Magic still have five players out for protocols.
Also Saturday, Cavaliers rookie forward Evan Mobley entered health and safety protocols.
Mobley has been a major reason for Cleveland’s unexpected and surprising start this season. The No. 3 overall draft pick has been as good as advertised while helping the Cavs go 18-12 and surge into fourth spot in the Eastern Conference standings.
Mobley missed four games earlier this season with an elbow sprain, and the Cavaliers lost them all. Mobley also sat out Cleveland’s 35-point win over Houston on Wednesday with a hip injury not believed to be serious.
Cleveland, which won just 22 games last season, is riding a five-game winning streak heading into Saturday’s game at Milwaukee. The Bucks will be without superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo, who was placed in the protocols earlier this week.
Cavaliers swingman Isaac Okoro was also placed in protocols on Thursday, and the coronavirus has sidelined several other prominent players across the NBA.
A number were missing in Boston, where the Knicks added rookie Miles McBride to an injury report that grew to six players in health and safety protocols. The Celtics also have six players in protocols.
“Nobody is feeling sorry for you,” Celtics coach Ime Udoka said. “The league is what it is and guys are coming and going on every team. That’s when you look at your mainstays and guys that are available to carry you.”
Toronto’s Pascal Siakam and Dalano Banton entered the protocol before the Raptors faced Golden State in Saturday night.

The NFL’s decision to reduce COVID-19 testing for asymptomatic, vaccinated players could signal a trend for pro sports leagues and provide an example for society to follow heading into 2022.
Despite a rising number of positive cases that forced three games to be rescheduled over the weekend, the NFL, in cooperation with the players’ union, agreed Saturday to scale back testing for vaccinated players. The move aligns with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC recommends “diagnostic testing” only for symptomatic or close-contact vaccinated people, and “screening tests” only for unvaccinated people.
The NFL previously required vaccinated players to get tested weekly before amending the protocols. The NFLPA had advocated for daily testing for vaccinated players but eventually agreed to “target” testing.
The NBA didn’t require vaccinated players to get tested during the season but revised its policy to increase testing for a two-week period starting Sunday.
The NHL tested players every third day but returned to daily testing through at least Jan. 7.
“I think the NFL is actually going to be a really interesting and I think really safe real-world experiment on what our new normal is likely going to look like,” Dr. Vin Gupta, a pulmonologist and professor at the University of Washington, said in an interview with the AP. “And, it’s safe to say that the NFL is obviously a large vaccine bubble, sans a few high-profile exceptions.
""We can’t continue the status quo, ad infinitum, where we are testing regularly people that are otherwise healthy, asymptomatic, triple-vaccinated, just to detect the asymptomatic individual who might be positive ... because then you’re going to quarantine that individual who might be asymptomatic or having mild symptoms, who is triple-vaccinated, who might for a small period of time, be infectious to others who presumably are also vaccinated.”
Almost 95 percent of NFL players and nearly all coaching staffs are vaccinated.
Gupta, an informal consultant for the Seattle Seahawks on COVID-19 issues and an adviser for baseball's Seattle Mariners, says the NFL is “ahead of the curve” with target and voluntary testing.
“I think they’re able to do things that the rest of the country is unable to do because they have a vaccine bubble, and they can control things to a certain degree that we can’t control across the public at large, and so it’s an interesting experiment,” Gupta said. “We have to build policies and procedures and case management protocols around positive tests that make sense, given our reality.”
On Monday, the first day under the NFL’s revised protocols, 47 players were placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list, the most in a single day since the pandemic began. Several players were asymptomatic and vaccinated, a person familiar with the results told the Associated Press.
The league says Monday’s results are evidence its new “smarter” and more “strategic” testing policy is working. Positive cases were identified and the players were isolated. Players who test positive must quarantine until they’re cleared to return. Under the new procedures, vaccinated players can return in fewer than 10 days.
“We want someone to return after they are no longer a risk for themselves or a risk to others,” said Dr. Allen Sills, the NFL’s chief medical officer. “We’ve looked at our data very carefully there. We have obviously continued to evolve that definition over time and we believe we can bring a further degree of precision to that process on how people can return by fine-tuning that in a way that fits into the protocols.”
But many people have questioned the league’s motives for changing testing protocols at a time when the number of positive cases have increased rapidly due to the Omicron variant.
“The other side is that they’re going to have more players that are out there that are infected that are potentially transmitting to other players and leading to a greater burden of infections,” said Dr. David Hamer, professor of global health and medicine at Boston University. “This change in plan makes me nervous mainly because of Omicron surging.”
It’s fair to wonder if the NFL is putting its desire to finish the season uninterrupted ahead of health and safety. But the league and its team of doctors point to science and data.
“We are always analyzing our data and particularly our outcomes,” Sills said. “We are looking at our protocols, together with our experts, together with the Players’ Association. We are looking at them to see how we achieve the safest possible environment for everyone and that causes us to need to constantly respond to adapt the protocols. And so clearly, with the emergence of this new variant, which, as I said, in many ways seems like a new disease, has been an opportunity to reevaluate every aspect of our protocols, and has led to some of the changes.
“We believe what we are doing actually now will mimic what we have been doing in health care for quite a while now. ... We are not routinely testing asymptomatic, vaccinated health care workers, doctors, etc. We are testing those who become symptomatic and meet certain criteria. So, we are really just joining what has been done in health care based on our own experience and the experience in health care up to this point.”
Along with new testing policies, the league over the past week has emphasized booster shots for players, mandated the boosters for coaches and other staff, and provided options for virtual meetings. All players are provided home tests and anyone can be tested whenever they want.
“I think there is a lot we have learned from health care and I think it is very relevant to try and use some of the exact same strategies that are routinely used in health care when it comes to the NFL population as well,” said Dr. Deverick Anderson, Professor of Medicine at the Duke Center for Antimicrobial Stewardship and Infection Prevention and co-founder and co-owner of Infection Control Education for Major Sports.

New WHO Global Air Quality Guidelines aim to save millions of lives from air pollution
Air pollution is one of the biggest environmental threats to human health, alongside climate change.
22 September 2021
Copenhagen and Geneva
Reading time:
New WHO Global Air Quality Guidelines (AQGs) provide clear evidence of the damage air pollution inflicts on human health, at even lower concentrations than previously understood. The guidelines recommend new air quality levels to protect the health of populations, by reducing levels of key air pollutants, some of which also contribute to climate change.
Since WHO’s last 2005 global update, there has been a marked increase of evidence that shows how air pollution affects different aspects of health. For that reason, and after a systematic review of the accumulated evidence, WHO has adjusted almost all the AQGs levels downwards, warning that   exceeding the new air quality guideline levels is associated with significant risks to health. At the same time, however, adhering to them could save millions of lives.
Every year, exposure to air pollution is estimated to cause 7 million premature deaths and result in the loss of millions more healthy years of life. In children, this could include reduced lung growth and function, respiratory infections and aggravated asthma. In adults, ischaemic heart disease and stroke are the most common causes of premature death attributable to outdoor air pollution, and evidence is also emerging of other effects such as diabetes and neurodegenerative conditions. This puts the burden of disease attributable to air pollution on a par with other major global health risks such as unhealthy diet and tobacco smoking.
Air pollution is one of the biggest environmental threats to human health, alongside climate change. Improving air quality can enhance climate change mitigation efforts, while reducing emissions will in turn improve air quality. By striving to achieve these guideline levels, countries will be both protecting health as well as mitigating global climate change.
WHO’s new guidelines recommend air quality levels for 6 pollutants, where evidence has advanced the most on health effects from exposure. When action is taken on these so-called classical pollutants – particulate matter (PM), ozone (O₃), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and carbon monoxide (CO), it also has an impact on other damaging pollutants.
The health risks associated with particulate matter equal or smaller than 10 and 2.5 microns (µm) in diameter (PM₁₀ and PM₂.₅, respectively) are of particular public health relevance. Both PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ are capable of penetrating deep into the lungs but PM₂.₅ can even enter the bloodstream, primarily resulting in cardiovascular and respiratory impacts, and also affecting other organs. PM is primarily generated by fuel combustion in different sectors, including transport, energy, households, industry, and from agriculture. In 2013, outdoor air pollution and particulate matter were classified as carcinogenic by WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).
The guidelines also highlight good practices for the management of certain types of particulate matter (for example, black carbon/elemental carbon, ultrafine particles, particles originating from sand and dust storms) for which there is currently insufficient quantitative evidence to set air quality guideline levels. They are applicable to both outdoor and indoor environments globally, and cover all settings.
“Air pollution is a threat to health in all countries, but it hits people in low- and middle-income countries the hardest,” said WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “WHO’s new Air Quality Guidelines are an evidence-based and practical tool for improving the quality of the air on which all life depends. I urge all countries and all those fighting to protect our environment to put them to use to reduce suffering and save lives.”
An unequal burden of disease
Disparities in air pollution exposure are increasing worldwide, particularly as low- and middle-income countries are experiencing growing levels of air pollution because of large-scale urbanization and economic development that has largely relied on the burning of fossil fuels.
“Annually, WHO estimates that millions of deaths are caused by the effects of air pollution, mainly from noncommunicable diseases. Clean air should be a fundamental human right and a necessary condition for healthy and productive societies. However, despite some improvements in air quality over the past three decades, millions of people continue to die prematurely, often affecting the most vulnerable and marginalized populations,” said WHO Regional Director for Europe, Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge. “We know the magnitude of the problem and we know how to solve it. These updated guidelines give policy-makers solid evidence and the necessary tool to tackle this long-term health burden.”
Global assessments of ambient air pollution alone suggest hundreds of millions of healthy life years of life lost, with the greatest attributable disease burden seen in low and middle-income countries. The more exposed to air pollution they are, the greater the health impact, particularly on individuals with chronic conditions (such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart disease), as well as older people, children and pregnant women.
In 2019, more than 90% of the global population lived in areas where concentrations exceeded the 2005 WHO air quality guideline for long term exposure to PM₂.₅. Countries with strong policy-driven improvements in air quality have often seen marked reduction in air pollution, whereas declines over the past 30 years were less noticeable in regions with already good air quality.
The road to achieving recommended air quality guideline levels
The goal of the guideline is for all countries to achieve recommended air quality levels. Conscious that this will be a difficult task for many countries and regions struggling with high air pollution levels, WHO has proposed interim targets to facilitate stepwise improvement in air quality and thus gradual, but meaningful, health benefits for the population.
Almost 80% of deaths related to PM₂.₅ could be avoided in the world if the current air pollution levels were reduced to those proposed in the updated guideline, according to a rapid scenario analysis performed by WHO. At the same time, the achievement of interim targets would result in reducing the burden of disease, of which the greatest benefit would be observed in countries with high concentrations of fine particulates (PM₂.₅) and large populations.
Note to editors
Whilst not legally-binding, like all WHO guidelines, AQGs are an evidence-informed tool for policy-makers to guide legislation and policies, in order to reduce levels of air pollutants and decrease the burden of disease that results from exposure to air pollution worldwide. Their development has adhered to a rigorously defined methodology, implemented by a guideline development group. It was based on evidence obtained from six systematic reviews that considered more than 500 papers. The development of these global AQGs was overseen by a steering group led by the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health.

How to Design a World-Killing Comet
Amy Mainzer, one of NASA’s lead asteroid hunters, and the director Adam McKay, who collaborated on the film “Don’t Look Up,” chat about ways to neutralize an oncoming space rock (explosives!) and the likelihood of an apocalyptic collision (low!).

Save this story for later.
In 2002, Amy Mainzer was finishing her doctorate in astronomy at U.C.L.A. when an astronomer colleague discovered an asteroid. A few years later, she got a nice surprise: he had named it after her. Asteroid nomenclature is regulated by the International Astronomical Union, based in Paris, and vanity naming, Mainzer said recently, is “one of the perks” of her field. The asteroid, 234750 Amymainzer, is about seven and a half kilometres in diameter. Were it to crash into Earth, she said, it would cause an “extinction-­level event.”

On her laptop, she called up Caltech’s Infrared Science Archive and found it: a tiny red dot on what resembled a square of colorful sandpaper. “Fortunately for the world, I am safely locked in orbit in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, so the world is safe from me,” she concluded. Mainzer is an expert in asteroid detection and planetary defense. She is the principal investigator for NASA’s Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer mission (NEOWISE), which NASA calls “the largest space-based asteroid-hunting project in history,” and teaches at the University of Arizona. At the moment, she was in Los Angeles, in connection with her latest mission: consulting for the Netflix end-of-the-world comedy “Don’t Look Up.”
In the movie, directed by Adam McKay (“Vice”), a punky Ph.D. student, Kate Dibiasky (Jennifer ­Lawrence), discovers a comet, christened Comet Dibiasky, which she and her professor Dr. Mindy (Leonardo DiCaprio) calculate will hit Earth in six months and fourteen days. What happens next is eerily familiar. The President (Meryl Streep), a venal nincompoop, worries about her poll numbers. Dr. Mindy becomes a nerdy sex symbol. (McKay conceived the film pre-pandemic, before Brad Pitt played Dr. Fauci on “Saturday Night Live.”) A denialist movement springs up. Although the film is an allegory for our inability to face crises—climate change, COVID—without descending into lunacy, the astronomy had to add up. “A movie that’s supporting science should honor science,” McKay said. “So I wanted to make sure all the math is correct.” He was joining Mainzer on Zoom, from his home office in L.A., where he was sprawled on a couch (he has an essential tremor) in a T-shirt. Mainzer, in a leather jacket, was at a nearby hotel. That week, they had hosted a screening for scientists. “It was good to hear that our science was pretty accurate,” McKay said. Many attendees were relieved that the professor and the student didn’t have a romantic subplot.
McKay and Mainzer first connected two years ago, when McKay was writing the screenplay. One issue was Comet Dibiasky’s size, which McKay had imagined at thirty-two kilometres in diameter. “I said, ‘No, no—if it’s too big, people just throw up their hands,’ ” Mainzer recalled. They settled on nine kilometres: big enough to wipe out humanity, but small enough that there was a chance of stopping it. Mainzer had pushed for a longer interval between discovery and impact, since you’d want four or five years to build a comet-busting spacecraft, but, for dramaturgical reasons, McKay stuck with six months. “It would be like doing ‘Jaws’ where the shark attacks take place over a fourteen-year period,” he said. “Which, by the way, is much more likely for the occurrence of shark attacks.”
“You talkin’ to me? You talkin’ to me? It’s been a little while since I read a social cue.”

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/23/business/dealbook/cryptocurrency-code-law-technology.html,"For Cryptocurrency, the Challenge Is to Balance Code and Law","This article is part of our latest DealBook special report on the trends . DeFi money market protocol Compound, in an interview in August.",1 month ago,"By Ephrat Livni
Nov. 23, 2021
This article is part of our latest DealBook special report on the trends that will shape the coming decades.
The first time the Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig told computer scientists they were the unwitting regulators of the digital age — about 20 years ago — he made a coder cry. “I am not a politician. I’m a programmer,” Mr. Lessig recalls her protesting, horrified by the idea.
Now, the notion that “code is law”— from Mr. Lessig’s 1999 book “Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace” — does not shock young engineers or lawyers, the professor says. To digital natives it is “obvious” that technology dictates behavior with rules that are not value neutral.
Big tech companies have reluctantly admitted the same, with Meta, the social media company formerly known as Facebook, going as far as establishing a courtlike board of experts to evaluate decisions dictated in part by programming. And one relatively young sector of tech — the cryptocurrency industry — has embraced the concept of “code as law” wholeheartedly, with some companies explicitly arguing that code can be a better arbitrator than traditional regulators.
Many crypto fans are betting on a future where we bank, create, play, work and trade on platforms with code running the show, and in the booming decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, automated “smart contracts” that are programmed in advance to respond to specific sets of conditions already handle billions of dollars in transactions daily, with no need for human intervention, at least theoretically.
Users put their full faith in programming. No one shares personal information. Code does it all and is supposed to be the whole of the law. “There’s no human judgment. There’s no human error. There’s no processes. Everything works instantly and autonomously,” said Robert Leshner, who founded the DeFi money market protocol Compound, in an interview in August.
But while the idea of a perfectly neutral, self-patrolling system is appealing, high-profile mishaps have cast doubt on the idea that code is a sufficient form of regulation on its own — or that it is immune to human mistakes and manipulation.
A smart contract executes automatically when certain conditions are met. So if there is a bug in the system, a user might be able to trigger an unearned transfer all while technically following the “law” of code. This is what allowed a $600 million theft this summer from the Poly Network, which lets users transfer cryptocurrencies across blockchain networks. The thieves are believed to have taken advantage of a flaw in the code to override smart contract instructions and trigger massive transfers, essentially tricking the automation into operating as if the proper conditions for a transfer were met.
“If you can tell a smart contract to ‘give me all your money’ and it does, is it even theft?” the computer scientist Nicholas Weaver of the University of California, Berkeley wrote about the theft . Unlike old-school agreements, Weaver wrote, ambiguities with smart contracts cannot be resolved in the courts and automated deals are irreversible — so developers must resort to begging when things go awry.
After the $600 million theft, the Poly Network tweeted a request that began, “Dear Hacker,” asking them to return the funds and calling the act “a major economic crime.” Ultimately, most of the money was returned, talk about law enforcement stopped and the hackers said they wanted to show the code was flawed to protect the network.
Similarly, a software upgrade in Compound in September resulted in $90 million being erroneously issued to users. Mr. Leshner said recipients who didn’t return the crypto would be reported to tax authorities , prompting outcry from his community for undermining claims that these programs cannot technically comply with traditional regulatory requirements to identify users. The request also undermined claims that DeFi has no need for oversight from traditional regulators — when a problem arose, Mr. Leshner cited government authority.
For now, DeFi platforms operate in a regulatory gray space, subject to the law of private coders who claim no control over the organization’s governing programs. Platforms and apps built for blockchain networks are often formed under a new kind of business structure known as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or DAO, ostensibly democratically governed by a community of users who vote with crypto tokens.
But there are always people behind the code, as disasters have shown.
“That it’s all code and no humans is simply not true. In cases of urgency, this is when you see where power lies,” said Thibault Schrepel, who teaches law at Amsterdam University and created the “computational antitrust” project at the Stanford University CodeX Center for Legal Informatics.
The reason no one wants to claim control of decentralized programs is because it limits liability — with no one in control, there is no one to punish for problems and nowhere to implement the law, Mr. Schrepel explained. “But the idea that code — alone — is sufficient, is wrong,” he said. And if the blockchain community uses code to evade regulation, Mr. Schrepel argues, this will only hamper innovation.
He is part of a generation of techno-lawyers who want to bridge the gaps between code and law. Ideally, he said, code and law could work together. Smart contracts on the blockchain could be used by businesses to collude or to enhance competition, so regulators could analyze code and software programming, cooperating with core developers of decentralized systems. Similarly, policymakers could start translating traditional notions of risk mitigation into code for decentralized finance programs, thinking about the equivalent of reserve requirements that banks have into parameters for programs.
“I’m not going to say it’s easy to advance our thinking,” said Chris Giancarlo of the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, a former chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and author of “CryptoDad: The Fight for the Future of Money.” Still, he asks, “Shouldn’t we try to rethink our approach to regulation to achieve the same policy goals, but in a different way?”
Mr. Lessig agrees. “We need a more sophisticated approach, with technologists and lawyers sitting next to behavioral psychologists and economists,” all defining parameters to code social values into programs so that private interests don’t replace them with their own. “We’re facing an existential threat to our democracy and we don’t have 20 years to wait.”

In 1987, a one-seat, one-pilot, “ Gary Powers [style] spy plane ,” loaded with sophisticated scientific instruments screamed into the lower stratosphere above Antarctica at 200 meters per second. Its mission: determine the cause of a mysterious ozone hole in Earth’s atmosphere.
“Basically, the story got told right there – almost immediately,” recalls David Fahey, an atmospheric chemist with the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), stationed in Boulder, Colorado. He was one of the scientists who worked through that night analyzing the data.
The team’s landmark findings confirmed that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), ubiquitous coolants used for decades as refrigerants and in foam production, were the culprits behind Earth’s thinning ozone layer.
Spurred on by accumulating scientific evidence, the world’s nations had crafted the 1987 UN Montreal Protocol to control the production and consumption of ozone-depleting chemicals. Since then, 197 countries and the European Union have ratified the binding treaty, and CFC levels have steadily declined in the atmosphere
In September 2019, the ozone hole was the smallest it had been since 1982 – marking a triumph for science and global diplomacy.
“The Montreal Protocol is the most successful international treaty on the environment of all time,” says Neil Harris, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Cranfield, UK. “It is working fully, and it continues to work.”
But success didn’t come without tremendous labor on the part of industry and nations – along with diligent monitoring by scientists, acting something like traffic cops with radar guns, measuring trace gases, and helping protect the ozone layer down to today. That due diligence is largely an untold story, with the treaty still actively evolving to meet new atmospheric pollution challenges as they arise.
Climate good news and bad news
The Montreal Protocol provided an added bonus for humanity: CFCs and their substitutes, the hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), in addition to being ozone-damaging, are also powerful greenhouse gases. So the phasing out of these chemicals benefited Earth’s climate too: From 1990–2010, the ban on harmful refrigerants reduced carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by an estimated 135 billion metric tons.
But there’s a catch to this success story, one playing out in diplomatic circles today. To replace the CFCs and HCFCs, manufacturers developed a new generation of coolants, the hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs. These chemicals don’t damage the ozone layer, but it turns out that they are bad for the climate – very bad. Many cause between 1,400 and 5,000 times more warming in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, according to a scientific finding that came in time to prevent their pouring into the atmosphere at dangerous levels.
Consequently, in 2016, national delegates agreed on the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which calls for cutting the production and use of HFCs by 80-85% by the late 2040s. The amendment entered into force at the start of 2019, with the goal of avoiding additional warming by up to 0.4º C by the end of the century.
On its path to conserving the ozone layer, the Montreal Protocol has faced many similar hurdles, including an unexpected and jarring increase in CFC emissions – a possible treaty violation by Chinese factories – discovered and corrected in just the last few years.

Now, a new, albeit similar, set of challenges could impede the implementation of the Kigali Amendment, as scientists and policymakers grapple on how to overcome them. To date, neither China nor the US have ratified Kigali, and they are the largest producers of HFCs – though the election of President Joe Biden and cooperation from China could soon change that.
“We want to make sure to lock in those climate benefits we got from the treaty in the past,” says NOAA’s Stephen Montzka, “and make sure they don’t go away.”
Learning from CFC-11
Every week, Jen Morse, a research technician at the University of Colorado Boulder, places four large gas canisters in her backpack and treks to a small green shack on Niwot Ridge, a blustery slope in the US Rocky Mountains. Once there, she traps the thin mountain air in her flasks, which she then delivers for analysis to NOAA’s Global Monitoring Division in Boulder.
Similar flask collections take place around the world – at observatories, on airplanes and ships. The goal: collect air not tainted by local pollution to provide a measure of the “background” atmosphere. Once the samples arrive at the lab, scientists from the gas monitoring group run them through their instruments to determine global levels of dozens of CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs.
“There’s so many science stories [found] in the amazing resource that comes from regularly measuring the global atmosphere, taking its pulse on a week-to-week, month-to-month, decade-to-decade basis,” Montzka says.
An example: Montzka had watched global levels of CFCs steadily fall for years, showing that countries were phasing out ozone-depleting gases in accordance with the Montreal Protocol. But then, one day in 2013, he received a nasty surprise: The levels of one gas, trichlorofluoromethane, known as CFC-11, were not dropping as fast as they had been . Someone, somewhere, was producing it, in violation of the treaty.
It took some time for the scientific community to identify that the new emissions were coming from China. Once notified, the Chinese government apparently quickly clamped down on the illegal production of CFC-11, as the levels of the gas are now declining closer to expectations. The incident highlights the importance of ongoing atmospheric monitoring in ensuring countries adhere to the protocol.
Now, the same rules are being applied to the Kigali Amendment, with signatory nations committed to reporting their production and consumption of HFCs, and relying on producers, exporters and importers to provide accurate statistics about what they’ve made and shipped.
“The Amendment relies on industry doing its job and collecting a comprehensive set of statistics, and governments faithfully reporting these values,” says Matthew Rigby, an atmospheric chemist at the UK’s University of Bristol.
The CFC-11 example shows that sometimes, however, production isn’t reported, and currently – and of global concern – there is insufficient infrastructure in place to identify when there’s a mismatch between a country’s reports and actual gas emissions.
While Montzka identified that emissions of CFC-11 were increasing globally and got a hint that some of the increase was from eastern Asia, it was regional monitoring stations on Jeju Island in South Korea, and Hateruma Island in Japan, operated by the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) network that offered vital clues as to the precise point of origin of the increasing emissions. Using that data, an international research team was able to determine that about half the global increase of CFC-11 was coming from the Chinese provinces of Shandong and Hebei.
Regional monitoring stations exist in the US and Europe and, in response to the recent crisis, China is now developing its own regional monitoring network. But there is presently no regional monitoring in India, the Middle East, Africa, Russia or South America.
“So, we don’t really have much idea about what’s going on in these places in terms of their greenhouse gas or ozone-depleting substance emissions,” Rigby says. “We’d really like to see a more extensive measurement network in the future.”
An ominous oddity
High in the Swiss Alps, at 3,450 metres, atmospheric chemist Martin Vollmer takes inventory of the atmosphere.
Vollmer, an atmospheric scientist at Empa/Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, works at the Jungfraujoch research station, perched on a glaciated saddle between the Jungfrau and Mönch peaks, where he monitors trace gases making up less than 1% of Earth’s atmosphere, including CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs – data summaries of which are reported twice yearly to Montreal Protocol delegates.
Although the alpine setting appears pristine, with its snow-capped, jagged peaks rising above a verdant valley floor, wafts of polluted air reach the station from nearby industrial centers, with telltale bad news for Earth’s climate. Over the years, while Vollmer has watched levels of most ozone-depleting gases fall, levels of HFCs are rising .
He and his colleagues have found “interesting” levels of a particular HFC coming from northern Italy. This gas, HFC-23, could be considered the bête noire of the HFC chemical class: each HFC-23 molecule is 12,700 times more effective at warming the climate than one molecule of carbon dioxide, and has the longest lifetime of all the HFCs – staying aloft for nearly 230 years.
Oddly, industry doesn’t create HFC-23 as a refrigerant or for any other use; its production is mostly incidental. When companies make hydrochlorofluorocarbon-22, (HCFC-22), HFC-23 is an unwanted byproduct. The Montreal Protocol called for a complete ban on the use of HCFCs as refrigerants in developed countries from Jan. 1, 2020, due to their ozone-damaging potential, but there’s a loophole: HCFC-22 can still be manufactured as a feedstock, or a starter chemical, used to make other chemicals such as Teflon.

“The Montreal Protocol put its main focus on the production and consumption of CFCs originally, and there was no focus on byproducts in manufacture or feedstock,” Vollmer explains. “There’s a cleaning up of these issues that needs to be done in the Montreal Protocol.”
When a country signs the Kigali Amendment, it agrees to destroy HFC-23 made during chemical manufacturing “to the extent practicable using technologies approved by the parties,” and to report on its HFC-23 emissions as a byproduct in HCFC production. But scientists like Vollmer have discovered that countries have not estimated their emissions of this gas accurately. Between 2008 and 2010, the Swiss scientists were able to determine that Italy emitted between 26 and 56 metric tons of HFC-23 annually, while the official Italian inventory estimated just two to three metric tons were coming from the region.
In 2015, China and India announced ambitious plans to decrease HFC-23 emissions and they stated two years later they had almost completely eliminated HFC-23 atmospheric releases. As a result, scientists expected to see an almost-complete halt in growth of the gas, “but actually what we saw was the emissions carried on, going up as they had been before,” Rigby reveals.
The discovery of this discrepancy, published in 2020 , again highlights the importance of persistent atmospheric monitoring for the future success of the Kigali Amendment. Monitoring is necessary to ensure that countries can make accurate estimates regarding their production of HFCs and also to check the honesty of their reporting, Rigby says.
“I think a major challenge for the Kigali Amendment is in the reporting of the production of HFCs and ensuring compliance,” he says. “It is still a somewhat unresolved issue that we’re going to need to keep an eye on if Kigali is going to be successful.”
US, China, India: Committing to the cause
Another barrier stands in the way of accomplishing Kigali’s goals. As of mid-April 2021, 119 countries have signed the Kigali Amendment, but the major HFC producers – China, India and the US – have not yet signed. China produces more than 60% of the world’s HFC gases today and, in 2018, the US produced 155 million metric tons of HFCs. The European Union’s HFC output for 2018 was less than two-thirds of this amount.
“For the Kigali Amendment to be successful, we want to have universal ratifications, but getting to this universal ratification is a challenge in itself,” says Megumi Seki , acting executive secretary of the UN Environment Programme’s Ozone Secretariat, headquartered in Nairobi, Kenya.
But recent news is encouraging: In April 2021, Chinese President Xi Jinping indicated that his nation, the world’s largest producer of refrigerants, will accept the Kigali Amendment and move toward ratification. Also, when Joe Biden assumed US presidency, he signed an executive order seeking US Senate ratification of the Kigali Amendment.

During the Obama administration, air conditioning and refrigeration manufacturers worked with the US government toward a plan to phase out the use of HFCs with high global warming potential, but that effort stalled under the Trump administration. Still, even with the Kigali Amendment unratified, the US Congress enacted the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act, in late 2020, which requires mandatory reductions in HFCs in alignment with the Kigali Amendment’s schedule. Now, AIM will help each segment of the US HFC market smoothly transition to climate-friendly alternatives.
“Having suitable alternatives to the ozone-depleting refrigerants was a key contributor to the success of the Montreal Protocol,” Seki says, and in the last two decades, industry has been investigating and developing HFC alternatives.
The latest generation of coolants, called hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs), neither damage the ozone layer nor contribute to climate warming, and encouragingly, Vollmer has tracked the rise of these compounds in the atmosphere. In 2011, for example, he didn’t find any HFO-1234yf in his samples, but by 2018, it was showing up in 71% of the air analyzed at Jungfraujoch. “From an atmospheric perspective, the replacement of the Kigali substances with HFOs is rather good,” Vollmer says.
‘Start and strengthen’
If, or when, China and the US ratify the Kigali Amendment, it will hopefully motivate other countries, including India, to sign on. Just this week, the US Environmental Protection Agency proposed a tough new rule cutting the use and production of HFCs. Meanwhile, the scientists who provide scientific assessments to the Montreal Protocol continue striving to improve HFC monitoring.
“There is a push for improving our capabilities, so that we can improve our understanding of regional changes with better coverage throughout the globe,” Montzka says.
At Jungfraujoch, researchers are expanding monitoring to measure more HFCs, while also devising a metric to determine whether the Kigali Amendment is being successful in terms of reducing HFC amounts being emitted. “The countries are the ones who measure production, sales and trades, but those numbers need to be verified and validated and that’s where we come in,” Vollmer says.
For policymakers who are preparing new environmental treaties, the key takeaway from the Montreal Protocol is that it is a living, ever-evolving document. The first iteration of the protocol in 1987 only called for the phaseout of five CFCs and three halons. Thirty years later, the treaty now covers about 100 ozone-depleting gases and 18 HFCs through an ever-evolving process of amendments and adjustments. “We sometimes refer to this as the ‘start and strengthen’ approach,” Seki says.
The healing of the ozone layer, and success of the protocol, has been an unfolding, rather than overnight, triumph, and it’s likely the Kigali Amendment will see a similar process. “I am sure the Kigali Amendment is just the first step on the phasing down of HFCs and that we’ll see further amendments and adjustments which will continue to strengthen it,” Rigby concludes.

Biden plan suddenly in serious danger 
President Biden’s $2 trillion climate and social spending bill, which appeared to have strong momentum when it passed the House a month ago, now appears to be in real danger of collapsing in the Senate.
Democratic senators now concede there is no chance of passing the Build Back Better Act before the end of the year as they had hoped.

Manchin says he does not oppose the tax credit, which he has backed in past legislation. 
But he argues that because the credit is likely to be renewed over the next decade, its true cost is not reflected in the current bill's official Congressional Budget Office score.
The West Virginia senator wants the bill to reflect the 10-year cost of the tax credit, which would require other tax hikes or spending cuts to prevent the official cost of the bill from rising heavily.

Opinion: Sorting out NI Protocol should be a ‘slam dunk’ affair
December 20, 2021, 1:44 pm
If Lizz Truss MP has any gumption, it shouldn’t take her too long to wrap up the small matter that is the Northern Ireland Protocol .
The cold facts of the affair are as follows: The EU wants a deal and the UK does not want to initiate a trade war with Brussels.
The end result should be a final scenario which sees Northern Ireland enjoying the best of all worlds – free and unfettered trading access to both the EU and UK markets.
The former Brexit negotiator, Lord Frost, had become an impediment to progress in all of these matters. Sorting out deals of any nature is all about giving and taking. Lord Frost never seemed to have the ability – nor desire – to see the EU’s perspective on most of the issues that got to the very heart of the protocol.
I also found it strange that he was sent to unpick a deal that he had been to the fore in securing at the very outset. If this was the implementation of some form of creative logic on the part of London, then it totally bamboozled me.   
Truss joins Northern Ireland Protocol debacle
Meanwhile, Truss brings with her a track record of rubbing British farmers up the wrong way.
While UK environment and rural affairs minister, she did very little to support production agriculture.
However, in her role as International Trade Secretary, she laid the foundations for the trade agreement recently agreed between the UK and Australia. A similar arrangement involving the UK and New Zealand is, more or less, over the line.

Both of these arrangements have the potential to see large quantities of cheap beef and dairy products heading for the UK from the southern hemisphere over the coming years.
Such an eventuality is bad news, in equal measure, for Irish and UK farmers. This is particularly so, where beef is concerned.
Trade deals and cheap food
The current government in London is totally wedded to a cheap food policy. The travel miles associated with the importation of food from Australia and New Zealand are enormous.
But Boris Johnson and his team of ministers seem to think this is a ‘price’ worth paying, despite the opprobrium vented upon them by environmental groups in the UK and beyond.
Adding to the hypocrisy of all this was the fact that the agreements with Australia and New Zealand were both agreed in the run-up to the UK’s chairing of COP26.
Liz Truss is now the UK’s Foreign Secretary. Gone are the days when Britain had its own bespoke Brexit Minister.
Where the Northern Ireland Protocol is concerned, she has a very simple question or two to answer: Does she sit down and complete a workable deal with Brussels in pretty short order or does she procrastinate?
The early weeks of 2022 will provide with us some answers.

India’s decision to ratify the amendment was never in doubt and is little more than a formality at this stage. It was widely anticipated after the United States and China, the world’s top producers and consumers of HFCs, took similar decisions in the last few months. The amendment has already come into force from the start of 2019. But the decision to ratify it does create the right atmospherics ahead of the annual climate change conference in Glasgow this November.
Ozone and climate
https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The 1989 Montreal Protocol is meant to protect the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere. It wasn’t originally an instrument to fight climate change. A set of chemicals, mainly the chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs, which were being used in the air-conditioning and refrigeration industry earlier, were found to be damaging the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere. Their extensive use had led to depletion of the ozone layer, and formation of an “ozone hole” over the Antarctic region. The Montreal Protocol mandated the complete phase-out of CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances (ODS), which it has successfully managed to do in the last three decades.
CFCs were gradually replaced, first by HCFCs, or hydrochlorofluorocarbons, in some cases, and eventually by HFCs which have minimal impact on the ozone layer. The transition from HCFCs to HFCs is still happening, particularly in the developing world.
HFCs, though benign to the ozone layer, were powerful greenhouse gases. With global warming emerging as one of the biggest global challenges in the new millennium, the use of HFCs came under the scanner. HFCs still form a small part of the total greenhouse gas emissions, but with air-conditioning demand showing a significant increase, especially in countries like India, their use is rising at about 8% every year. If left unabated, their contribution to annual greenhouse gas emissions is expected to reach up to 19% by 2050.
Because HFCs were not ozone-depleting, they were not controlled substances under the Montreal Protocol. They were part of the problematic greenhouse gases whose emissions are sought to be curtailed through climate change instruments such as the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 and the 2015 Paris Agreement. But the Montreal Protocol has been a far more effective and successful agreement than the climate change instruments. It has already resulted in the phase-out of 98.6% of ozone-depleting substances. The remaining 1.4% are the HCFCs that are in the process of being transitioned. Accordingly, it was decided to use the Montreal Protocol to phase out HFCs as well, rather than leave them at the mercy of climate change agreements. For that to happen, an amendment to the Montreal Protocol was required.
Climate Code Red | IPCC's new report on climate change explained
The Kigali Amendment
In 2016, countries agreed to include HFCs in the list of controlled substances under Montreal Protocol and decided on a schedule for its phase-down. Before the middle of this century, current HFC use has to be curtailed by at least 85 per cent. Countries have different timelines to do this. India has to achieve this target by 2047 while the developed countries have to do it by 2036. China and some other countries have a target of 2045.
While the reductions for the rich countries have to begin immediately, India, and some other countries, have to begin cutting their HFC use only from 2031.
If implemented successfully, the Kigali Amendment is expected to prevent about 0.5°C rise in global warming by the end of this century. No other single intervention to cut greenhouse gas emissions comes even close to this in terms of returns offered and the ease of implementation. It is thus considered crucial to achieving the Paris Agreement target of restricting temperature rise to within 2°C from pre-industrial times.
And the Montreal Protocol has a fairly good track record on ensuring climate benefits as well. CFCs, the predecessors to HFCs, were also greenhouse gases, apart from being ozone-depleting. Their phase-out has already avoided an estimated 135 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions between 1990 and 2010. This is three times the current annual greenhouse gas emissions. The UNEP estimates that, with Kigali Amendment, the avoided emissions could touch 420 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by the end of the century.
India’s efforts
India had played a key role in negotiating the Kigali Amendment. It had fought hard to get an extended timeline for itself, and some other countries, for the reduction of HFC use. This was considered important for the domestic industry which was still in the process of transitioning from HCFCs to HFCs. The climate-friendly alternatives to HFCs are not yet widely available at low cost. The extended timeline was meant to give the industry some cushion to make the transition.
Despite being one of the main architects of the Kigali Amendment, India was the last major country to announce its decision to ratify it. There wasn’t ever any doubt over its ratification, and it was more like a waiting game to see what China or the United States did. In the meanwhile, however, India had unveiled an ambitious action plan for the cooling industry which accounts for the phase-out of HFCs.
The 20-year ‘India Cooling Action Plan’, or ICAP, released in 2019, describes cooling as a “developmental need” and seeks to address the rising demand in cooling, from buildings to transport to cold-chains, through sustainable actions. The plan estimates that the national cooling demand would grow eight times in the next 20 years, which would result in a corresponding five to eight-fold rise in the demand for refrigerants that involve the use of HFCs. The ICAP aims to bring down the refrigerant demand by 25 to 30 per cent in the next 20 years.
As part of the ICAP, the government has also announced targeted R&D efforts aimed at developing low-cost alternatives to HFCs. Such efforts are already underway at the Hyderabad-based Indian Institute of Chemical Technology and IIT Bombay.

Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning
The Minister of the Environment and Spatial Planning Andrej Vizjak attended the last meeting of the Environment Council to be held during the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the EU. The Slovenian Presidency presented a report on the progress made in negotiations on the proposal for a regulation concerning batteries and waste batteries, which is an integral part of the European Green Deal. The proposals contained in the “Fit for 55” package were the main priority of the Slovenian Presidency, which strived for the greatest possible progress and a coherent approach to dealing with dossiers that are highly horizontal in nature.
The ministers also exchanged views on the new EU Soil Strategy, in particular in focusing on the adequacy of the measures envisaged and the legislative regulation of this area at EU level.
Under the Slovenian Presidency, the ministers also held the first formal debate on the ""Fit for 55"" legislative package aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and achieving climate neutrality by 2050. However, due to the large number and scope of proposals, their interrelatedness and their political importance, work on most dossiers is still at an early stage. There is a clear understanding among Member States that joint proposals should reach the agreed level of climate ambition set out in the European Climate Act. Minister Vizjak also emphasised: “During its term of office, the Slovenian Presidency sought to ensure the greatest possible progress in dealing with individual dossiers within the package. The Presidency held debates proposed by the Commission on legislative acts that come under the remit of the Environment Council and also addressed the initial major problems and issues identified by the member states. The upcoming French Presidency will thus be able to start a more detailed debate on individual legislative acts and start looking for individual compromise solutions.”
Despite intensive discussions, some issues outlined in the progress report on the negotiations on the proposal for a regulation on batteries and waste batteries, in particular the scope of regulation (inclusion of a separate category of batteries for light transport vehicles), the degree of flexibility in waste battery management and change the purpose of batteries, methods and content of information, and especially deadlines for the implementation of individual requirements or appropriate transitional periods for the adjustment of economic operators, have remained outstanding. Many Member States maintain reservations relating to oversight due to the complexity of the requirements. Minister Vizjak emphasized that ""the Slovenian Presidency has dedicated 13 informal videoconferences to the Working Group on the Environment and prepared a draft compromise text based on the comments of delegations and technical explanations from the Commission""  and explained that “the progress report clearly identifies the main issues over which delegations expressed concern.”
The ministers also exchanged views on the new EU Soil Strategy, in particular in the light of the adequacy of the measures envisaged and the legislative regulation of this area at EU level. According to the strategy, approximately 70 % of the soil is in poor condition and the strategy's vision is to provide healthy soil before 2050. To this end, it sets a series of medium-term goals by 2030 and long-term goals by 2050, most of which are based on existing initiatives and legislation and are set horizontally and cover a number of areas. The Slovenian Presidency considers that an integrated and highly balanced framework will need to be provided, steering the content in the right direction, stressing that national specificities must be taken into account in its preparation.
The Slovenian Presidency will also report on some major international meetings and sessions, including the meeting of the Parties to the Climate Change Convention (COP26) in Glasgow in November and the Barcelona Convention on the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea and its Protocols.
At the end of the meeting, Minister Vizjak thanked the Trio of Presidencies and expressed his support for the efforts being made with regard to making progress on outstanding dossier issues equally during the French Presidency.

The latest ‘Still Only One Earth’ policy brief from IISD looks back at when “the world was struck with fear” in 1985 after scientists discovered a massive hole in the ozone that forms a protective layer over the Earth. The brief reviews the steps taken to heal the ozone layer through two intergovernmental agreements – the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer – and what else must be done. It also highlights lessons for addressing climate change.
Author Kate Helfenstein reports that the adoption of the Convention and Protocol helped to avoid two million cases of skin cancer per year, and delayed the increase in climate forcing—the change in globally averaged temperature changes due to natural or human-induced activities—by 7-12 years.
the Montreal Protocol shows what is possible when science, diplomacy, and business cooperate to implement international environmental agreements. 
The brief explains that the Montreal Protocol shows what is possible when science, diplomacy, and business cooperate to implement international environmental agreements. It makes the story of the ozone layer “one of multilateralism’s great successes.” The Montreal Protocol is crafted so that as scientific evidence shows a need for further action, adjustments and amendments can be made. The most recent of these science-based updates is the Kigali Amendment, which addresses hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). As a result of this Amendment, the world can avoid 0.4°C of global warming by 2100.
The Protocol also established a Multilateral Fund to help provide financial resources ensuring that all countries are able to comply with their obligations to protect the ozone layer. Parties also set differentiated phase-out and phase-down schedules. With these two features the Protocol addresses the differentiated circumstances of all Parties.
The private sector has also been key to ensuring success, particularly the early commitment of DuPont, the leading CFC manufacturer at the time, to completely phase-out of CFCs. More recently, in the run-up to the adoption of the Kigali Amendment, Coca-Cola  announced its goal to ensure new coolers and vending machines would be HFC-free by 2015. 
Helfenstein writes that the Montreal Protocol provides the hope that other urgent environmental issues can be resolved swiftly and amicably, particularly if all stakeholders work together. In the words of David Doniger, Natural Resources Defense Council, “We saved the ozone layer. We can save the climate.”
The ‘Still Only One Earth’ series is being published by IISD in the lead-up to the 50th anniversary of the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm+50). The briefs assess successes and shortcomings of five decades of global environmental policy. [ Still Only One Earth policy brief series ] [Publication:  Healing the Ozone Layer Through Diplomacy ]

1. Secure global net-zero by mid-century and keep 1.5 degrees within reach
At the National Conference on COP26 Charter of Actions, held on October 13, Natalie Toms, Chief Economist, Climate and Development Counsellor at the British High Commission in India said: “The UK has already committed to bringing 78% emission reductions by 2035 and is on the road to net-zero by 2050. India has also taken important steps with its 450 gigaWatt renewables target and national hydrogen mission. Different countries will have different pathways, and we recognise the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.”
The UNFCCC recommends that countries ‘accelerate the phase-out of coal, curtail deforestation , speed up the switch to electric vehicles and encourage investment in renewables’ to meet this goal.
At the National Conference on COP26 Charter of Actions, Navroz K. Dubash, Senior Fellow at Centre for Policy Research, detailed what India could do to reach its targets:
* It is time for India to update its Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs. (NDCs detail the various efforts taken by each country to reduce the national emissions)
* Sector by sector plans are needed to bring about development. We need to decarbonise the electricity, transport sector and start looking at carbon per passenger mile.
* Aggressively figure out how to transition our coal sector
“Time may have come for India to announce that we will not be building any more coal-fired power plants beyond what is in the pipeline. India also needs to ramp up the legal and institutional framework of climate change,” he adds.

2. Adapt to protect communities and natural habitats
Countries will work together to ‘protect and restore ecosystems and build defences, warning systems and resilient infrastructure and agriculture to avoid loss of homes, livelihoods and even lives.’
3. Mobilise finance
“To deliver on our first two goals, developed countries must make good on their promise to mobilise at least $100bn in climate finance per year by 2020,” notes the UNFCCC.
Anne-Marie Trevelyan, UK Secretary of State for International Trade said in a release: “With the impacts of COVID-19 , it is vitally important we work together to scale up finance from all sources and improve access (to finance). We must push for all countries to have National Adaptation Plans in place and to produce Adaptation Communications sharing best practices to help turn ambition into action.”
4. Work together to deliver
Another important task at the COP26 is to ‘finalise the Paris Rulebook’. Leaders will work together to frame a list of detailed rules that will help fulfil the Paris Agreement.

The 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in is being held in Glasgow in the UK.
29 October 2021
Climate and Environment
In a world shaken by a pandemic, and a fast-closing window of opportunity to avoid climate catastrophe, the pivotal COP26 UN climate conference kicks off this Sunday in the Scottish city of Glasgow - the stakes could not be higher. 
“Without decisive action, we are gambling away our last chance to – literally - turn the tide”, UN Secretary-General António Guterres has said ahead of the meeting. But why could it be our last chance?
Here’s some answers we’ve found to the most common questions you might have about what’s coming up.
Let’s start with the basics, what is COP26?
To keep it simple, COP26 is the biggest and most important climate-related conference on the planet.
In 1992, the UN organised a major event in Rio de Janeiro called the Earth Summit, in which the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) was adopted.
In this treaty, nations agreed to ""stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere” to prevent dangerous interference from human activity on the climate system. Today, the treaty has 197 signatories.
Since 1994, when the treaty entered into force, every year the UN has been bringing together almost every country on earth for global climate summits or “COPs”, which stands for ‘Conference of the Parties’.
This year should have been the 27th annual summit, but thanks to COVID-19 , we’ve fallen a year behind due to last year’s postponement – hence, COP26.

So, what happens at COP26? Don’t we have enough meetings about climate change already?
Various “extensions” to the UNFCCC treaty have been negotiated during these COPs to establish legally binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions for individual countries, and to define an enforcement mechanism.
These include the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, which defined emission limits for developed nations to be achieved by 2012; and the Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, in which all countries of the world agreed to step up efforts to try and limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial temperatures, and boost climate action financing.
So, here’s where COP26 gets interesting: during the conference, among other issues, delegates will be aiming to finalise the ‘Paris Rulebook’, or the rules needed to implement the Agreement. This time they will need to agree on common timeframes for the frequency of revision and monitoring of their climate commitments.
Basically, Paris set the destination, limiting warming well below two degrees, (ideally 1.5) but Glasgow, is the last chance to make it a reality.

In Bangladesh, efforts are undertaken to improve coastal protection from flooding caused by storms and a rise in sea level due to climate change.
So, this brings us to our initial question: why is it the last chance?
Like a boa constrictor that slowly squeezes its prey to death, climate change has gone from being an uncomfortable low-level issue, to a life-threatening global emergency, in the past three decades.
Although there have been new and updated commitments made by countries ahead of COP26, the world remains on track for a dangerous global temperature rise of at least 2.7°C this century even if Paris goals are met.
The science is clear: a rise of temperatures of that magnitude by the end of the century could mean, among other things, a 62% increase in areas scorched by wildfires in the Northern Hemisphere during summer, the loss of habitat of a third of the mammals in the world, and more frequent four to 10 month-long droughts.
UN chief António Guterres bluntly calls it “climate catastrophe”, one that it is already being felt to a deadly degree in the most vulnerable parts of the world like sub-Saharan Africa and Small Island States, lashed by rising sea levels. 
Millions of people are already being displaced and killed by disasters exacerbated by climate change.
For Mr. Guterres, and the hundreds of scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a scenario of 1.5°C warming, is the “only liveable future for humanity”.
The clock is ticking, and to have a chance of limiting the rise, the world needs to halve greenhouse gas emissions in the next eight years.
This is a gigantic task that we only will be able to do if leaders attending COP26 come up with bold, time-bound and front-loaded plans to phase out coal and transform their economies to reach so called net zero emissions .

Hmm, but didn’t countries like China and the United States already commit to net zero?
The most recent UN Emissions Gap Report explains that a total of 49 countries plus the European Union have pledged a net zero target.
This covers over half of global domestic greenhouse gas emissions, over half of global GDP and a third of the global population. Eleven targets are enshrined in law, covering 12 per cent of global emissions.
Sounds great right? But there’s a catch: many of the commitments delay action until after 2030, raising doubts over whether these net zero pledges can actually be achieved. Also, many of these pledges are “vague” and inconsistent with the officially submitted national commitments, known as NDC’s.
This again explains why COP26 is so important: “The time has passed for diplomatic niceties...If governments - especially G20 governments - do not stand up and lead this effort, we are headed for terrible human suffering”, warned Guterres in the UN General Assembly this week.

So, what exactly is COP26 hoping to achieve (practically speaking)?
The official negotiations take place over two weeks. The first week includes technical negotiations by government officials, followed by high-level Ministerial and Heads of State meetings in the second week, when the final decisions will be made – or not.
There are four main points that will be discussed during the conference according to its host, the United Kingdom:
1.     Secure global net zero by mid-century and keep 1.5 degrees within reach
To do this, countries need to accelerate the phase-out of coal, curb deforestation, speed up the switch to greener economies.  Carbon market mechanisms will be also part of the negotiations.
2.     Adapt more to protect communities and natural habitats
Since the climate is already changing countries already affected by climate change need to protect and restore ecosystems, as well as build defences, warning systems and resilient infrastructure.
3.     Mobilise finance
At COP15, rich nations promised to channel $100 billion a year to less-wealthy nations by 2020 to help them adapt to climate change and mitigate further rises in temperature.
That promise was not kept, and COP26 will be crucial to secure the funds, with the help of international financial institutions, as well as set new climate finance targets to be achieved by 2025.
4.     Work together to deliver
This means establishing collaborations between governments, businesses and civil society, and of course, finalising the Paris Rulebook to make the Agreement fully operational.
In addition to formal negotiations, COP26 is expected to establish new initiatives and coalitions for delivering climate action.

How, when and where?
The main event will be held at the Scottish Event Campus, from 31 October to 12 November, with the possibility of negotiations spilling over an extra day or two. So far, there are over 30.000 people registered to attend representing governments, businesses, NGOs, and civil society groups.
The 197 Parties to the UNFCCC treaty, often get in groups or “blocs” to negotiate together such as the G77 and China, the Africa Group, the Least Developed Countries, the Umbrella Forum, the Small Island Developing States, and the Independent Alliance of Latin America and the Caribbean.
The negotiations also include observers, which have no formal part in them but make interventions and help maintain transparency. Observers include United Nations agencies, intergovernmental organizations, NGOs, faith-based groups, and the press.
But besides the official negotiations, there will be a conference, a pavilion, and thousands of side events happening, divided over thematic days, on topics like finance, energy, youth and public empowerment, nature, adaptation, gender, science and innovation, transport, and cities. 
The conference will happen across two zones – The Blue Zone (Scottish Events Campus), and the Green Zone located at the Glasgow Science Centre.
The Blue Zone is a UN-managed space where negotiations are hosted, and to enter all attendees must be credited by the UNFCCC Secretariat. 
The Green Zone is managed by the UK Government and open to the public. It will include events, exhibitions, workshops and talks to promote dialogue, awareness, education and commitments on climate change.
Anyone famous attending?
Several heads of state and government including UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Joe Biden are expected to attend. Other famous faces in Glasgow will include Sir David Attenborough, the COP26 people’s advocate, activist Greta Thunberg, the famous Game of Thrones actress Maisie Williams and singer-songwriter and UNEP ambassador Ellie Goulding. The Queen announced with regret, on Tuesday, that she would not be travelling to the event’s main reception after all.

And with such a big conference, are there any special COVID-19 measures?
While COVID-19 continues to be a huge challenge across the world, tackling the climate crisis cannot wait according to the COP26 hosts.  
In-person negotiations are preferred over online ones, to ensure inclusive participation by high and low-income countries as well as ensuring scrutiny and transparency.
Fully vaccination is encouraged for those attending the conference, and the United Kingdom ran a programme ahead of time, to deliver vaccines to participants living in countries unable to get one.
There will also be strict COVID-19 testing protocols in place, including daily testing for everyone entering the Blue Zone to ensure the health and wellbeing of all those involved and the surrounding community.
There are also COP-specific arrangements for the COVID Travel Regime people will encounter as they enter England and Scotland, with some countries requiring quarantine (which will be funded by the UK Government for attendees in difficult circumstances.

The annual climate change meetings are part of a UN-backed process initiated in the early 1990s after the world realised that greenhouse gas emissions were powering a rise in temperature that would slowly make the Earth uncomfortable to live in. Over the years, these meetings have had remarkable success in bringing climate change to the top of the global agenda, and ensuring that every country has an action plan to tackle climate change. This process has also delivered two international agreements — Kyoto Protocol in 1997 and Paris Agreement in 2015 — aimed at cutting down global emissions (see box).
The outcomes of these meetings, however, have not matched the scale of the response required. The original objectives, in terms of the amount of emission reductions and the principles that would govern the international climate architecture, have been diluted severely. Most industrialised countries have failed to deliver on their initial promises, not just on emission reductions but also on their commitments to help with finance and technology. As a result, the climate crisis has worsened in the last 20 years, manifesting itself in more frequent and intense extreme weather events.
Despite the shortcomings, however, these meetings remain the best bet to put the world on a path away from climate disasters.

Carbon markets
The rules and procedures of the landmark Paris Agreement of 2015 are still hanging because countries are yet to agree on some of the provisions related to creation of new carbon markets. Carbon markets are an important instrument to facilitate emissions reductions, and were an integral part of the Kyoto Protocol that has now given way to Paris Agreement.
Under the Kyoto Protocol, a set of rich and industrialised countries were allotted specific emission reduction targets. One of the indirect ways to achieve these was to let countries buy carbon credits from developing countries. The latter had no obligations under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce their emissions, but if they were able to do so, they could earn carbon credits. Developed countries could buy these credits and count them towards achieving their targets. Developing countries did not lose anything, and instead received payment to finance their switch to cleaner technologies.
Because emission reductions anywhere helped the entire globe, this was seen as a win-win situation for everyone. There were a couple of other methods through which carbon credits were traded, for money, both within and between countries.
Over the years, developing countries like China, India, and Brazil accumulated large numbers of carbon credits, which at one point, were in great demand as developed countries had to achieve their targets, and this was often a cheaper way than to reduce emissions by upgrading their own industrial facilities.
However, as the clamour grew for a new agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which rich industrialised countries found constraining, the motivation of the developed countries to move towards their targets reduced. Countries realised that non-achievement of their targets did not carry any penalty. So, most never met their targets. Several others even walked out of the Kyoto Protocol. The result was a big drop in demand for carbon credits, and a consequent fall in the price of carbon.
But countries such as India, China and Brazil continued to earn carbon credits in the hope that demand would return, once a successor pact to the Kyoto Protocol was in place. That happened with the Paris Agreement.
Carbon markets are envisioned in the Paris Agreement as well, but a new problem arose. Developed countries said they would not allow the transition of the earlier carbon credits to the new market mechanism, claiming many of these were dubious and did not accurately represent emission reductions. They sought more robust methods to grant carbon credits. The developing countries are insisting that their accumulated carbon credits, worth billions, remain valid in the new market.
This remains the last stumbling block in the finalisation of the rules and procedures of Paris Agreement. Most other issues were negotiated at the previous meeting in Madrid in 2019. Settling this is one of the main objectives of the Glasgow meeting.
Net zero
An agreement on carbon markets would involve intricate negotiations. The discussion on net-zero targets, in the meanwhile, is much more attention grabbing. Incidentally, the issue of net-zero, or carbon neutrality, does not find a mention in the Paris Agreement, and therefore, does not form part of the process. But this is not the first time that an issue that has not grown organically from the COP meetings has come to dominate a session.
More than 50 countries have pledged to carbon-neutrality by middle of the century. China has said it would achieve this status by 2060; Germany has announced a target of 2045. India is the largest emitter that still does not have a net-zero commitment, and has said it does not intend to commit mmediately. Several other developing countries have also been resisting such targets, arguing it is the developed world’s way of shifting their own burden of reducing emissions on to everyone else.
Last week, in a virtual meeting, ministers of 24 nations, which call themselves ‘Like Minded Developing Countries’, or LMDCs, denounced the efforts to force a net-zero target on everyone, saying it went against ‘equity’ and ‘climate justice’. India is a part of LMDC, and interestingly, so is China. Other members include Indonesia, Malaysia, Iran, Bangladesh, the Philippines and Sri Lanka.
Reminding the developed world that the COP meetings were a history of their “broken promises”, the LMDC said it was lack of adequate action on the part of rich nations that had led to worsening of the climate crisis.
“Despite their lack of ambition shown in the pre-2020 period, as well as in their Paris Agreement NDCs (nationally-determined contributions), major developed countries are now pushing to shift the goal posts of the Paris Agreement from what have already been agreed by calling for all countries to adopt Net Zero targets by 2050. This new ‘goal’ which is being advanced runs counter to the Paris Agreement and is anti-equity and against climate justice,” the ministerial statement said.
“Demands for ‘Net zero’ emissions for all countries by 2050 will exacerbate further the existing inequities between developed and developing countries,” it said.
It is clear that discussions on net-zero are also likely to lead to fireworks at Glasgow.

The Glasgow meeting was the 26th session of the Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP26. These meetings are held every year to construct a global response to climate change. Each of these meetings produce a set of decisions which are given different names. In the current case, this has been called the Glasgow Climate Pact.
Earlier, these meetings have also delivered two treaty-like international agreements, the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 and the Paris Agreement in 2015, which form the global architecture for actions to be taken to tackle climate change. While the Kyoto Protocol expired last year, the Paris Agreement is now the active instrument to fight climate change.
The main task for COP26 was to finalise the rules and procedures for implementation of the Paris Agreement. Most of these rules had been finalized by 2018, but a few provisions, like the one relating to creation of new carbon markets, had remained unresolved. However, due to clear evidence of worsening of the climate crisis in the six years since the Paris Agreement was finalized, host country United Kingdom was keen to ensure that Glasgow, instead of becoming merely a “procedural” COP, was a turning point in enhancing climate actions. The effort was to push for an agreement that could put the world on a 1.5 degree Celsius pathway, instead of the 2 degree Celsius trajectory which is the main objective of the Paris Agreement.

Hence, more than 100 heads of states and governments were invited to attend the meeting and lend their political weight behind the process. So many leaders have assembled on only two earlier occasions, at the climate meetings in Copenhagen in 2009 and Paris in 2015. On both those occasions, the COPs were aiming to deliver a major agreement. Copenhagen had failed in that, but Paris had succeeded.
Glasgow did benefit from the presence as many of them also announced new and enhanced climate actions. However, the final agreement was a mixed bag, as most such pacts invariably are.
What was achieved
Mitigation: The Glasgow agreement has emphasised that stronger action in the current decade was most critical to achieving the 1.5-degree target. Accordingly, it has:
Asked countries to strengthen their 2030 climate action plans, or NDCs (nationally-determined contributions), by next year
Established a work programme to urgently scale-up mitigation ambition and implementation
Decided to convene an annual meeting of ministers to raise ambition of 2030 climate actions
Called for an annual synthesis report on what countries were doing
Requested the UN Secretary General to convene a meeting of world leaders in 2023 to scale-up ambition of climate action
Asked countries to make efforts to reduce usage of coal as a source of fuel, and abolish “inefficient” subsidies on fossil fuels
Has called for a phase-down of coal, and phase-out of fossil fuels. This is the first time that coal has been explicitly mentioned in any COP decision. It also led to big fracas at the end, with a group of countries led by India and China forcing an amendment to the word “phase-out” in relation to coal changed to “phase-down”. The initial language on this provision was much more direct. It called on all parties to accelerate phase-out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies. It was watered down in subsequent drafts to read phase-out of “unabated” coal power and “inefficient” fossil fuel subsidies. But even this was not liking to the developing countries who then got it changed to “phase down unabated coal power and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies while providing targeted support to the poorest and the most vulnerable in line with national circumstances…”. Despite the dilution, the inclusion of language on reduction of coal power is being seen as a significant movement forward.
Adaptation: Most of the countries, especially the smaller and poorer ones, and the small island states, consider adaptation to be the most important component of climate action. These countries, due to their lower capacities, are already facing the worst impacts of climate change, and require immediate money, technology and capacity building for their adaptation activities. As such, the Glasgow Climate Pact has:
Asked the developed countries to at least double the money being provided for adaptation by 2025 from the 2019 levels. In 2019, about $15 billion was made available for adaptation that was less than 20 per cent of the total climate finance flows. Developing countries have been demanding that at least half of all climate finance should be directed towards adaptation efforts.
Created a two-year work programme to define a global goal on adaptation. The Paris Agreement has a global goal on mitigation — reduce greenhouse gas emissions deep enough to keep the temperature rise within 2 degree Celsius of pre-industrial times. A similar global goal on adaptation has been missing, primarily because of the difficulty in defining such a target. Unlike mitigation efforts that bring global benefits, the benefits from adaptation are local or regional. There are no uniform global criteria against which adaptation targets can be set and measured. However, this has been a long-pending demand of developing countries and the Paris Agreement also asks for defining such a goal.
Finance: Every climate action has financial implications. It is now estimated that trillions of dollars are required every year to fund all the actions necessary to achieve the climate targets. But, money has been in short supply. Developed countries are under an obligation, due to their historical responsibility in emitting greenhouse gases, to provide finance and technology to the developing nations to help them deal with climate change. In 2009, developed countries had promised to mobilise at least $100 billion every year from 2020. This promise was reaffirmed during the Paris Agreement, which also asked the developed countries to scale up this amount from 2025. The 2020 deadline has long passed but the $100 billion promise has not been fulfilled. The developed nations have now said that they will arrange this amount by 2023.

What does the Glasgow Agreement say?
A deal aimed at staving off dangerous climate change has been struck at the COP26 summit in Glasgow. The pact has:
Expressed “deep regrets” over the failure of the developed countries to deliver on their $100 billion promise. It has asked them to arrange this money urgently and in every year till 2025
Initiated discussions on setting the new target for climate finance, beyond $100 billion for the post-2025 period
Asked the developed countries to provide transparent information about the money they plan to provide

Here’s why Centre’s new SOP may damage Environment Impact Assessment regime
MoEF&CC’s new guidelines no deterrent; rather, they send a message to violators to ‘pay their way through’
 
By Anubha Aggarwal
Published: Wednesday 14 July 2021
The latest guidelines from the Union Ministry for Environment, Forest and Climate Change ( MoEF&CC ) to prevent violations of green norms actually seem yet another attempt to weaken the  Environment Impact Assessment  (EIA) regime.
The  National Green Tribunal (NGT) had asked the ministry to formulate a standard operating procedure, keeping the ‘polluter-pays’ principle and the ‘principle of proportionality’ in mind. The green bench was concerned by continuous violation of environmental norms by infrastructure and industrial projects.  
The environment ministry’s office memorandum (OM) dated July 7, 2021, empowers regulatory institutions at both central and state level:
To identify and report cases of violation 
To take action against violators in terms of closure or demolition of a project
To levy penalty on them that is akin to the scale of the project
There have been many instances in the past by MoEF&CC to weaken the EIA process. The final nail in the coffin was the introduction of  draft EIA Notification, 2020 which received a lot of flak from civil society, academicians and environmentalists. Consequent to the public outrage, the draft is under scrutiny at present.
However, experts are of the opinion that there is an ill-conceived push to introduce sections of the draft EIA, 2020 as OMs on the pretext of scrutiny. The present OM seems like another such experiment that has been replicated from the draft EIA 2020 and elbowed through the backdoor without any consultation with the public.
The current memorandum by the ministry is the outcome of the NGT coming across grievances over the last several years where projects were completed without grant of prior environmental clearance (EC) and the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) failed to abide by the “rule of law” requiring “demolition” or “payment of assessed compensation” from the project proponent.
The following case scenarios will be categorised as ‘Violation’: First, on-site construction or installation or excavation without obtaining EC; Second, expanding the production capacity and / or project area beyond the limit specified in the existing EC letter; and Third, changing scope of the project such as modification in product/s without prior approval from the ministry or SEIAA.
‘Non compliance’ refers to not complying with the terms and conditions prescribed in the EC letter of the project awarded by the MoEF&CC or SEIAA.
The new norms
Identification of violation cases and their reporting 
Clause 13 of the OM includes the provision to identify, examine and appraise violation projects, to refrain them from causing further environmental damage and also to compensate for causing damage to the environment.
Under this provision, the  Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), state pollution control board (SPCB) and union territory Pollution Control Committee (UTPCC) are directed to identify cases of violation under their respective jurisdiction and report it to MOEF&CC in the case of Category A projects and to the SEIAA in case of Category B projects for further action.
SPCBs and UTPCCs have also been directed to not issue or renew Consent to Operate (CTO) to entities that do not have prior EC.
The violation can also be reported suo motu by the proponent itself. The OM includes an additional provision stating “The CPCB, SPCBs and UTPCCs shall expeditiously examine the references received from the public and others in relation to violation and take necessary actions”.
This provision was missing in the draft EIA 2020 notification and has caused a huge outcry among environmentalists all over the country. They demanded that the public be allowed to report violations.
The current OM has included this provision. However, it has not defined what references could be submitted for the consideration of authorities. There is also no mechanism elaborated upon how these complaints are to be registered.
There is also no established procedure to ensure that the complaints made against the violator are not dismissed without hearing. This ambiguity in the memorandum leaves scope for a less transparent redressal mechanism.
Handling of violation cases
Clause 11 of the OM defines three different actions to be taken for the violation projects depending upon their EC status. In case the project has not obtained EC, it will be ordered to close its operations. If the project has undergone expansion without obtaining EC for the expanded portion, it will be ordered to revert the activity / production to the limit granted in the existing EC.
There might be projects which do not require EC according to their earlier production. But an EC is required after expansion. Such projects will be ordered to restrict the production / activity where EC was not required. For all these projects, actions will be initiated according to the Environment Protection Act, 1986.
This clause tries to highlight the thoughtful approach of MoEF&CC towards the protection of the environment. However, there is a catch in this clause. All the three actions mentioned above for projects will be temporary and will be in effect till those projects do not get the required EC.
This implies that these projects will be given an opportunity to apply for a fresh EC and undergo the appraisal process by MoEF&CC in case of category A projects and SEIAA in case of category B projects.
While appraising the violation cases, the appraisal committee will scrutinise the project on the basis of its environmental sustainability and will determine whether the project will be permitted to operate further or not. 
In case the project is found to be ‘Not Permissible’ for EC at the time it was started, the project will be ordered to be demolished / closed down permanently. However,the project which is found otherwise  permissible, but not environmentally sustainable in its present form, will be directed to modify to fulfill the requirements of environmental sustainability.
The projects which are found to be permissible and environmentally sustainable will be asked to submit the complete EIA and the Environmental Management Plan report of the project. These projects will also be required to undertake damage assessment, remediation plan and community augmentation plan to restore the environmental damage caused by the project including its social aspects.
The project proponent will have to submit the bank guarantee equivalent to the summation of damage assessment, remediation and community resource augmentation cost to the CPCB in case of category A projects and SPCB in B category projects. The quantification of this amount will be recommended by the appraisal committee.
Mechanism for scrutinising violation by projects
 
The detailed mechanism laid out in the current OM to allow operation of permissible and sustainable projects is nothing new and is exactly the same as provided in draft EIA notification, 2020.
However, the OM misses out on providing any system to demand remediation and restoration of environmental damage from the projects which will be directed permanent closure or demolition. Although these projects will not be allowed to operate further, the violator should be made liable for the environmental and social damage inflicted during its operational period.
 Penalty on violating cases
In order to strengthen deterrence, clause 12 of the OM entitles the regulatory authorities to levy penalties on the proponent, in addition to the bank guarantee. The penalties have been broadly bifurcated for two kinds of projects — greenfield and brownfield.
In the case of greenfield projects where operation have not commenced, the penalty is one per cent of the total project cost incurred upto the date of filling of application alongwith EIA / EMP report. In the case of greenfield project where operation have commenced, the penalty is one per cent of the total project cost incurred upto the date of filling of application alongwith EIA / EMP report plus 0.25 per cent of total turnover.
However, the penalties on both project cost and turnover will be halved if the proponent suo motu reports the violation. This provision in the memorandum though will surely act as an enabler for the proponent to come forward.
The penalties suggested in the office memorandum could be termed as legitimating non-compliance. First, it is beyond logic as to how a Rs 100 crore company is not aware of  environmental rules and regulations. This indicates that the rules were flouted deliberately. 
Second, the penalty is meagre. For example: A Rs 1 crore penalty to be levied on a Rs 100 crore greenfield project will also be reduced to just Rs 50,00,000 if reported first by the proponent. Such a provision will never act as deterrence for violation. Moreover, they will tempt projects to start operation, pay a penalty and continue.

Explained: Paris Rulebook And Its Role In Global Climate Action & Politics
The world needs stronger guidelines to make countries pledge to more ambitious emissions cuts, report on their progress, as well as provide the promised  financial support to developing countries at the upcoming COP26, experts tell us
By

Mumbai: As world leaders prepare to meet in Glasgow, UK, in November 2021 for the COP26 , experts say they must bolster the 'Paris Rulebook' in order to obligate countries to set adequate emissions targets, report on their progress transparently, provide finance to developing countries to meet their commitments, as well as operationalise carbon markets.
The 2018 Paris Rulebook governs how the world community of 191 countries must pledge emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement and report on their progress. It also contains provisions for rich countries to provide climate action finance to developing countries. But the Paris Rulebook has been largely ignored, a new report and an IndiaSpend analysis show. Countries have not yet agreed to the transparency and accountability mechanisms that will enable independent verification of the adequacy of their targets and the success of their efforts to meet them, and as many as 40% of countries (78) are yet to submit updated and more ambitious pledges called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), which were due in 2020.
In 2015, when countries came together for the Paris Agreement , they pledged to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5-2°C by 2030. For this, by 2030, the world would need to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 25-45% from 2010 levels, but the current NDCs of all the countries together would decrease emissions only by around 12%, found a United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) report , published on September 17.
The Paris Rulebook does not compel countries to ramp up action, experts told IndiaSpend. ""The rulebook does not bridge the gap between what the countries pledged in their NDCs and what is required for them to actually minimise climate change,"" said Neha Pahuja, a fellow at The Energy and Resource Institute ( TERI ), a New-Delhi based think-tank.
""Due to the bottom-up nature of the Paris Agreement, countries were largely able to determine their own NDCs, accounting and compliance rules,"" said Shikha Bhasin, senior programme lead at the New-Delhi-based research nonprofit Council for Energy, Environment and Water ( CEEW ).
The rulebook's guidelines on ensuring ambitious targets to meet the temperature cap, on international carbon markets, as well as on providing finance and technological assistance to developing countries are weak and ineffective, experts tell us. World leaders must finalise key details and strengthen the rulebook to give the world a realistic chance of meeting the 2030 target. Here's what must be fixed.
What is the Rulebook?
In 2015, the Paris Agreement solidified long-term, international goals to tackle the climate crisis, including limiting the rise in global temperatures, increasing adaptation and resilience to climate change, and aligning financial flows with low-carbon and sustainable development. But details on implementing this global pact were left unclear.
In 2018, at the 24th COP in Katowice , Poland, countries agreed on the Paris rulebook for guidelines on implementing the Paris Agreement. The ""rulebook tells how the commitments need to be implemented and what are the obligations of the country towards meeting their commitment"", said Sumit Prasad, programme associate at CEEW. These include updating the NDCs every five years and rules on how to report on the steps taken to control climate change, he explained.
What countries did not agree on in the rulebook
Accountability: Countries had earlier had two agreements on controlling the climate crisis--the Kyoto Protocol , and the Doha Amendment , which extended and amended the Kyoto protocol--but countries had not accepted the targets under these agreements, said Prasad. Because of this, ""for the Paris agreement, strengthening accountability became important… but because the agreement is so decentralised, countries have avoided agreeing on common accountability and transparency mechanisms"", of the rulebook, he added.
Carbon trading: Carbon or emissions trading is one of the most debated topics in the rulebook negotiations, said Pahuja. A carbon market allows countries and companies, that are unable to  meet emissions targets, to buy carbon credits from those that have reduced emissions and have 'credits' for sale. For instance, from 2002 to 2012, Indian companies and the government together had earned hundreds of crores worth of carbon credits under the Kyoto Protocol by reducing industrial emissions, switching to renewable energy, energy efficiency in households and protecting forests , and sold some of them as credits to countries or companies that were likely to exceed their emission targets.
Carbon markets under the Kyoto Protocol were known as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Under CDM, countries could trade carbon credits--certificates that allow the holder to emit one ton of carbon dioxide or equivalent greenhouse gases. But 75% of carbon credits were unlikely to represent a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, found a 2015 report by the Stockholm Environment Institute , a policy research organisation. CDM enabled emission cuts in countries where it was cheap to make these reductions while greenhouse gas emissions continued in other countries, wrote researchers Oscar Reyes and Tamra Gilbertson in the UN Chronicle. Credits were given for even minor adjustments by industries that did not have a larger environmental impact, they wrote.
Implementing a carbon market requires strong accounting procedures, said Pahuja. Countries fear that emissions traded between buying and selling countries might be double counted, while countries might also misuse the rules of carbon trading. For instance, under lax rules, a country selling the carbon credit might claim the underlying emission reduction for itself, while at the same time, the country buying the credit might also claim the same emission reduction, she explained.
Some countries, including Brazil , have favoured double counting of carbon credits under the Paris Rulebook. Under the Kyoto Protocol, double counting was allowed, but at that time countries did not have any emission reduction targets.
Some countries oppose the idea of an international body overseeing carbon trading under the Paris Agreement [ reportedly Australia, Canada and Japan], and have argued for more control and flexibility between nations for buying and selling carbon credits.
What needs to be changed
Better enforcement of ambitious targets: The 26th COP is set to start the five-year process of updating emission reduction ambitions pledged by countries through their NDCs. So far, 77 countries , including the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK) and Canada , have announced net-zero targets.
But not all countries have ambitious targets and the rulebook fails to take notice of this, said Bhasin of CEEW. For instance, of Canada, the European Union, the UK and the US, only the UK's ambitions are rated in line with the steps needed for achieving the 1.5°C limit in temperature rise by 2030, according to the Climate Action Tracker put together by Climate Analytics and the New Climate Institute .
There is also pressure on countries, including India, to move towards net-zero emission targets, said Bhasin. Committing to net-zero targets would mean reducing emissions substantially and removing residual emissions through afforestation and deployment of expensive carbon capture technologies . In September 2020, China had announced it would achieve net-zero emissions by 2060. While India needs to take bold climate action, net-zero emissions is not a way forward given its economic circumstances, IndiaSpend reported in April 2021.
The emphasis on net-zero emissions also takes attention away from what countries are currently doing to limit climate change. ""This entire narrative of net-zero is not a requirement of the Paris Agreement. But talking about the future target is a very convenient way of not taking into account what countries should have done till date,"" said Bhasin.
Stronger emphasis on common but differentiated responsibility: The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted the common but differentiated responsibilities framework at the 1992 Rio climate summit . The framework acknowledges that richer countries have the responsibility for providing financial and technological assistance to developing and vulnerable countries to fight climate change. Further, not all countries would have similar emissions reduction targets, given that the historical responsibility of developing countries in greenhouse gas emissions is marginal compared to developed countries'. For instance, India accounted for 3% of the world's cumulative carbon emissions between 1850 and 2010, whereas the US accounted for 27%, according to the World Resources Institute .
India, along with countries in Africa and the Gulf, has reportedly demanded relatively softer language in the rulebook for developing countries. ""The rulebook looks at every country to be equally responsible, and while there are flexibilities to developing nations, they are still not enough,"" said Prasad of CEEW.
Enforce financial help from developed to developing countries: A lot of countries pledged their NDCs on the assumption that developed countries would provide financial and technological support to meet these targets, said Bhasin, but that has not happened.
Developed nations will fall short of providing up to $75 billion of the $100 billion committed per year between 2020 and 2025 to financially support developing countries to reduce their emissions and control global warming, an Oxfam report , published on September 20, estimated. In 2017-18, developed countries effectively provided between $19-$22.5 billion of the estimated $59.5 billion that they had reported to the UNFCCC as climate finance, according to Oxfam's Climate Finance Shadow Report 2020 . Further, 80% of all reported public climate finance for 2017-18 was not in the form of grants, rather loans and other non-grant instruments, the report estimated.

New Delhi is on track to overachieve its Nationally Determined Contribution, says head of COP 26.
Alok Sharma, president-designate, United Nations Conference of Parties (COP), said he hoped India would consider more ambitious emissions targets. Mr. Sharma is visiting India as part of a larger international tour building consensus among nations for concrete outcomes ahead of the 26th round of climate talks.
“I have been encouraged by the discussions I’ve had. India is on track to overachieve its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). I would request if India would consider any NDC that takes into account this overachieving,” Mr. Sharma told reporters on Wednesday. Among those he met in this three-day India tour were Environment Minister Bhupendra Yadav and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.
Carbon neutrality
A major theme building ahead of the climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, this November is the question of how many nations can commit to a net zero target and by when. Net zero or carbon neutrality is when more carbon is sucked out from the atmosphere or prevented from being emitted than what a country emits and is critical to ensuring that the planet doesn’t heat up an additional half a degree by 2100.
A little over 120 countries have committed, with varying degrees of firmness, to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. Five countries have net zero pledges set for after 2050, including Australia and Singapore, which haven’t set a firm target yet.
China, the world’s biggest emitter, has committed to peaking its emissions before 2030 and achieving net zero by 2060.
The United States has said it would achieve net zero by 2050 and nearly halve emissions by 2030. India is among the major countries that haven’t committed to a 2050 plan but has said it is one of the countries that has delivered on one of the 2015 Paris Agreements main goals that is taking steps to ensure that its emissions don’t put the globe on a road to heating one degree more than present by the turn of the century. Further, India’s position is that it has among the lowest per capita emissions, is not responsible for the climate crisis, which the science establishes is due to historical emissions by developed countries and cannot compromise on ensuring economic growth of its vast citizenry.
India’s NDC includes reducing the emissions intensity of GDP by 33%–35% by 2030 below 2005 levels; increase the share of non-fossil-based energy resources to 40% of installed electric power capacity by 2030, with help of transfer of technology and low-cost international finance including from Green Climate Fund (GCF) and to create an additional (cumulative) carbon sink of 2.5–3 GtCO2e through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. It has committed to installing 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030 of which 100 GW is reportedly installed.
Thorn of contention
A thorn of contention is the over-$100 billion that was to have come to developing countries from developed ones for clean energy investments and mitigation that continues to be outstanding. Mr. Sharma said Canada and Germany were working with his team to set out a “delivery plan”.
“Delivering the $100 billion a year is a matter of trust. Germany and Canada will be setting out a delivery plan until 2025 and have it in place before COP 26. For the years beyond 2025, that will certainly require trillions of dollars, much is expected to come from the private sector,” he said.
On Wednesday, the Union Cabinet approved ratification of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol that envisages phasing out of hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) by 80-85% of present levels by 2040 in a phased manner by all signatory countries. The HFC are used in refrigeration and contribute to global warming. India in 2016 committed to phasing down HFC in four steps from 2032 with a 10% reduction in 2032, 20% in 2037, 30% in 2042 and 80% in 2047.

Climate and Environment
In a UN first, a ferocious and talkative dinosaur bursts into the iconic General Assembly Hall at UN Headquarters in New York, with a special warning for any diplomats who still think climate action is for the birds.
“At least we had an asteroid,” the carnivorous critter warns, referring to the popular theory explaining dinosaurs’ extinction 70 million years ago. “What’s your excuse?” 
This isn’t a slice of real life of course, rather the key computer-generated scene from a new short film launched this Tuesday by the UN Development Programme ( UNDP ), as the centerpiece of the agency’s ‘Don’t Choose Extinction’ campaign. 
The dinosaur then tells the audience of bewildered diplomats that “it’s time humans stopped making excuses and started making changes” to address the climate crisis.  
A global production 
It’s the first-ever film to be made inside the General Assembly Hall using computer-generated imagery, known as CGI, and features global celebrities voicing the dinosaur in numerous languages, including actors Eiza González (Spanish), Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Danish), and Aïssa Maïga (French). 
UNDP research released as part of the campaign shows that the world spends $423 billion annually just to subsidize fossil fuels, enough to cover a  COVID-19 vaccination for every person in the world or three times the annual amount needed to eradicate global extreme poverty.  
 “Think of all the other things you could do with that money. Around the world people are living in poverty. Don’t you think that helping them would make more sense than…paying for the demise of your entire species?” the dinosaur says.

While countries at climate meetings regularly commit to collective action, few have been meeting their targets. These targets are not binding, and developing countries will require much more funding.

The annual climate meetings have succeeded in galvanising the world into taking collective action against climate change, but they have not been able to prevent the crisis from worsening in the last two decades. The quantum of action that these series of meetings has enabled has always been well short of what, science says, is required to avoid the catastrophic impacts of climate change.
Countries have missed their targets, reneged on promises made, and delayed their actions. The decision-making at these meetings has not always been guided purely by climate change considerations. Very often, economic and foreign policy imperatives have over-ridden environmental concerns.
As a result, the world seems to have got locked in a perennial firefighting mode, struggling to cope with the ever-increasing frequency of extreme weather events, which are a direct consequence of global warming.
Missed chances
https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
For most of the first two decades since climate change became a global issue — between 1990 and 2010 — very little action was taken to curb growing emissions. The first target, for the developed countries to return to their 1990 levels of emissions by 2000, was never taken seriously.
An international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was finalised at just the third climate change conference, in Kyoto in 1997, but it couldn’t be operationalised until 2005 in the absence of the requisite number of ratifications. The United States, the world’s largest emitter at that time, did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol and was thus not bound by it.
The Kyoto Protocol asked a group of 37 rich and industrialised countries to collectively achieve a modest 5 per cent reduction in their emissions from 1990 levels during the ‘first commitment period’ of 2008-2012. Except the European Union, and some of its individual member countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom (which was then in the EU), most of the countries did not achieve the target.
Russia and the east European economies, however, saw a dramatic drop in their emissions after the collapse of the Soviet era. It helped a great deal in ensuring that the collective emissions of this group of countries fell by 22 per cent, well above the 5-per-cent target.
Data from the World Resources Institute show that the emissions of the US in 2012 were marginally higher than they were in 1990, meaning there was no reduction. Australia’s emissions went up by about 15 per cent.
Highest emitters in 1990, and what’s changed since
Global emissions went up by 40 per cent between 1990 and 2012, thanks mainly to the rapid rise of China and India, which continues to this day. China overtook the United States as the world’s leading emitter around 2007. Its current emissions are more than 4 times the 1990 levels. India’s emissions have grown over 3.5 times from 1990.
Newly growing economies
But countries such as China, India and similar fast-growing economies such as Brazil, South Africa or Indonesia, were not mandated to cut down their emissions, because of well-justified reasons. Over 90 per cent of the accumulated greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the reason for global warming, had come from the rich and industrialised countries over the last 150 years. Countries such as India and China had begun to develop only in the 1980s and 1990s, and needed the space to grow their economies in order make the lives of their people better. This is what gave rise to the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC), the most endearing and empowering provision for the developing countries.
But while they had little contribution in the “historical emissions”, industrial activity in China, India and other major developing countries was leading to their emissions growing at a very fast pace. That was a major grouse for the developed countries, which felt that a free pass to these countries was also handing them an unfair economic advantage at their cost.

Researchers from the UK, New Zealand, and the US have said that the Montreal Protocol was essential in protecting carbon stored in plants.
Studies in the polar regions have shown that high-energy ultraviolet rays reduce plant biomass and damage DNA, compromising plants’ ability to store carbon.
The international treaty, which phased out the production of ozone-depleting chemicals, has prevented between 0.6-1º C of global warming, according to research.
The international treaty that phased out the production of ozone-depleting chemicals has prevented between 0.65°C and 1°C of global warming, according to research.
The study also showed that carbon stored in vegetation through photosynthesis would have dropped by 30% without the treaty, which came into force in 1989.
Researchers from the UK, New Zealand, and the US wrote in Nature that the Montreal Protocol was essential in protecting carbon stored in plants. Studies in the polar regions have shown that high-energy ultraviolet rays (UVB) reduce plant biomass and damage DNA. Forests and soil currently absorb 30% of human carbon dioxide emissions.
“At the ends of our simulations, which we finished around 2100, the amount of carbon which is being taken up by plants is 15% the value of our control world where the Montreal Protocol is enacted,” said lead author and atmospheric scientist Paul Young of Lancaster University.
In the simulation, the UVB radiation is so intense that plants in the mid-latitudes stop taking up a net increase in carbon.
Plants in the tropics fare better, but humid forests would have 60% less ozone overhead than before, a state much worse than was ever observed in the Antarctic ozone hole.
A ‘world avoided’
The study used a chemistry climate model, a weather-generating tool, a land surface model, and a carbon cycling model. It links ozone loss with declines in the carbon sink in plants for the first time.
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), ozone-depleting chemicals phased out by the Montreal Protocol, are potent greenhouse gases. The study estimated that CFCs would warm the planet an additional 1.7º C by 2100. Taken together, the damage from UVB radiation and the greenhouse effect of CFCs would add an additional 2.5°C warming by the century’s end. Today, the world has warmed, on average, 1.1°C at the surface, leading to more frequent droughts, heat waves, and extreme precipitation .
Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere would reach 827 parts per million by the end of the century too, double the amount of carbon dioxide today (~ 412 parts per million).
The work analysed three different scenarios: The first assumes that ozone-depleting substances stayed below 1960 levels when massive production kicked in. The second assumes that ozone-depleting chemicals peaked in the late 1980s before tapering off. The last assumes that ozone-depleting chemicals increase in the atmosphere every year by 3% through 2100.
The last scenario, called the ‘World Avoided’, assumes not only that the Montreal Protocol never happened but also that humans had no idea CFCs were harming ozone, even when the effects would become clear in the 2040s. The models also assume one kind of UVB damage to all vegetation, when in reality, plants react differently .
‘Change is possible’

“The Montreal Protocol is regarded as one of the most successful global environmental treaties,” said University of Leeds atmospheric scientist Martyn Chipperfield , who was not involved in the research. “CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances are potent greenhouse gases, and the Montreal Protocol is known for having real benefits in addressing climate change by removing previous levels of high CFCs from the atmosphere.”
The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol in 2016 brought climate change to the forefront. Countries agreed to gradually phase out hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are used in applications such as air conditioning and fire extinguishing systems. HFCs originally replaced hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and CFCs because they do not harm ozone. Yet HFCs are potent greenhouse gases.
The Montreal Protocol was the “best accidental climate treaty,” said Young. “It is an example of where science discovered there was a problem, and the world acted on that problem.”
Injecting sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere has been proposed as one geoengineering solution to slow global warming. “People are seriously talking about this because it’s one of the most plausible geoengineering mechanisms, yet that does destroy ozone,” Young said. Calculating the harm to the carbon cycle is “the obvious follow-up experiment for us.”
The research highlights the importance of the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) this fall, which will determine the success of worldwide climate targets.
Immediate and rapid reductions in greenhouse gases are necessary to stop the most damaging consequences of climate change, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

An update to the Mining Association of Canada’s standard changes how companies should tackle risks and opportunities from climate change

The Mining Association of Canada (MAC) released a new “Climate Change Protocol” for its Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM) standard on May 5, one of eight such protocols that member companies use to measure and publicly report their performance against in annual TSM progress reports. As 75 per cent of Canada’s minerals and metals production is represented by MAC’s membership, this action will trigger a significant change in how most mining companies in Canada report on their plans for handling both the physical and financial challenges posed by climate change. 
The change from the protocol’s old title, the “Energy and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Management Protocol”, reflects a general expansion of the types of climate-related information member companies will need to report. In particular, the protocol is characterized by an increased focus on adaptation to and mitigation of the potential consequences of environmental change, with explicit grading criteria for how businesses plan to anticipate and adapt to the risks and opportunities presented by those changes. This is a significant departure from the 2015 protocol, which focused mainly on emissions standards. To put it in perspective, the new protocol contains 31 references to “adaptation,” where the 2015 version contained none.
That difference is not merely superficial, and extends to the specific content of the protocol’s assessment criteria. According to MAC senior vice-president Ben Chalmers, “When you look at the substance of the protocol, it’s about more than just emissions reduction. It’s about strategy, it’s about adaptation. The old protocol didn’t speak at all to climate adaptation, where the new one does.”
 This means that MAC member companies will have to provide more explicit and detailed plans for how they intend to meet the challenges presented by environmental change. For instance, in order to receive an A rating in the second of the three indicators, “Facility and Climate Change Management,” operators will need to demonstrate that they have “[a] process for the management of physical climate impacts and adaptation,” which includes not only assessment and identification of potential risks from the physical effects of climate change, but also the “identification, prioritization and implementation” of business planning that responds to those risks.

“How do you make sure that your infrastructure can handle extreme weather events? How do you make sure that you have a secure source of water? How do you make sure that you’re protected and adapting to the changing climate, and how do you work with your communities around that?,”asked Chalmers as he pointed out some of the questions that can help identify those risks.
Another major expansion is in climate-related financial and corporate disclosure criteria. These new criteria were developed from the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures’ 2017 report, which emphasized the need to adapt to not only the physical ramifications of climate change, but the financial consequences as well. Both the shift away from natural gases and fuels promised by the 175 parties to the Paris agreement, and the inherent uncertainty and risk surrounding climate change itself, according to that report, mean companies need to provide more accurate financial information in order to help investment, insurance, and lending markets appropriately assess and price climate-related risks and opportunities.
According to TSM program director Katherine Gosselin, the new TSM protocol, “Actually goes beyond the requirements of that task force – which are really around disclosing your climate strategy, scenario-planning, risk-assessment, that sort of thing – and putting in place criteria for companies to have all of those things in place, to have really comprehensive systems for things like corporate governance and strategy, risk assessment, metrics and targets around climate change. So, an important point to note is that beyond having them just disclose things in those areas, we’re making sure they’re doing something meaningful in each of those areas.”
Both Chalmers and Gosselin highlighted that TSM has been influential not only within Canada’s mining industry, but also in other countries where associations are seeking a format to publicly demonstrate adherence to a set of climate change standards in response to societal or investor pressure. Gosselin said that “[s]ince we have eight other associations who are now actively implementing TSM and a number of others looking to work with MAC to implement TSM in their jurisdictions [...], they’ll be looking at how to adapt [the standard] into their national context. These will also be things presented to their member companies as new and ambitious targets for them to consider in the development of their own protocols.”

Phasing down HFCs is expected to achieve a nearly 90% reduction in global warming resulting from unconstrained HFC use.
India said it will develop a national strategy for phasing down HFCs in the coming year, in consultation with the industry and conclude by 2023.
The move to ratify the Kigali Amendment will further strengthen India’s position at the Montreal Protocol.
Ahead of the upcoming 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, countries are ramping up their climate ambition. India, a critical global stakeholder in charting a low carbon future, greatly exemplified its climate leadership today by approving the ratification of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, the global pact to phase down super-warming hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).
HFCs are on average several thousand times more potent than carbon dioxide. Phasing down HFCs – which are used in cooling appliances, insulating foams and more – is expected to avoid close to 0.5º C of warming by the end of the century and achieve a nearly 90% reduction in global warming resulting from unconstrained HFC use. Abated emissions from India representing a significant share of this total.
India’s ratification follows China’s earlier this year and will be the 123rd ratification of this important treaty amendment. India has for decades played a key role in bringing about the success of the Montreal protocol, the hugely successful international environmental treaty on which the Kigali Amendment is based. India’s ratification of the Kigali Amendment sends a strong signal to the rest of world about its commitment to the treaty moving forward, encouraging other countries to ratify and signalling that a rapid global market transition is soon to begin.
As part of the announcement to ratify, the government also laid timelines for putting together the implementation strategy. India will develop a national strategy for phasing down HFCs in the coming year, in consultation with the industry, and conclude by 2023. The government also plans to update its existing legal framework by mid-2024 to phase out ozone-depleting substances (the Ozone Depleting Substances (Regulation and Control) Rules to allow appropriate control of the production and consumption of Hydrofluorocarbons to ensure compliance with the Kigali Amendment.
India’s commitment to phasing down HFCs will usher in global and domestic environmental and economic benefits. It will give a boost to India’s domestic manufacturing and employment generation goals, spurring domestic innovation and attracting international investments. The global marketplace is shifting to low-GWP refrigerant production, and early adoption of low-GWP refrigerants will lead to a competitive advantage. Manufacturers and stakeholders agree that the Montreal Protocol is an effective vehicle for refrigerant market transformation , including room ACs. Early adoption now signals to the industry that India will continue to have strong demand for low-GWP equipment; this will help attract industry to manufacture in India.
Ratification is also yet another step forward in India’s climate change and cooling commitments. In a country already experiencing extreme heat waves, which is likely to further intensify as per a new climate report , cooling is an absolute necessity. Ratifying the Kigali Amendment demonstrates that India has a plan to provide much-needed cooling for millions while balancing the need to protect the environment. Adopting low-GWP refrigerants will enable India to achieve both its development and climate action targets.
This move also further strengthens India’s position at the Montreal Protocol. India has already established strong climate credentials from its work on the Montreal Protocol for several decades. Ratifying the Kigali Amendment further strengthens India’s influence and goodwill around the globe, and will help bolster its efforts to establish smart policies and bylaws, including energy efficiency, while phasing down HFCs.
India showed leadership in 2019, when it was one of the first countries to release the India Cooling Action Plan ( ICAP ), which sets domestic targets for cooling efficiency and refrigerants. ICAP provides short-, medium- and long-term recommendations on interventions across differing refrigerant sectors to reduce HFC usage, cooling demand and advance sustainable cooling and thermal comfort for all. India’s ratification will help advance the progress made thus far and ramp up ICAP’s implementation.
India has also proactively implemented and accelerated its efforts to phase out first-generation fluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs – the predecessors to HFCs) under the Montreal Protocol, taking decisive domestic action and accelerating its phase-down past stated commitments. India’s HCFC Phase-out Management Plan 2 (HPMP2) also includes plans for India’s largest AC manufacturers to switch to a refrigerant known as R-32, which has relatively lower GWP than HFC 410a and HCFCs.
The adoption of R-32 through HPMP-2 is enabling India to leapfrog high-GWP refrigerant R 410A. Its industries have already led the world in developing alternatives for HFCs. The insulating foams sector, a major prior user of fluorinated gases, has avoided uptake of HFCs almost entirely. And India’s room AC market has the largest segment of climate-friendly R-290-based models in the world.
The HFC phasedown is part of what it will take to meet India’s vast unmet cooling demand sustainably in the future, which is expected to grow by nearly eight times by 2037 compared to 2017. To meet this, demand for refrigerant is set to grow by nearly as much in the coming three decades, growth that, thanks to India’s adoption of the Kigali Amendment and formal ratification, will now be met by gases that do not significantly impact climate.
There is still a lot to be done to identify and scale up manufacturing of these new substances and products, but an affirmation by the Indian Government on HFCs sends a strong signal to the industry that the HFC phase-down is afoot and the time to innovate has arrived. This will also lead to a ripple effect, encouraging other major economies to ratify and moving the Amendment to universal ratification, sooner than later.

New rules adopted by nearly 200 nations
Deal implements Paris pact article
Trillions of dollars may be unlocked for projects
GLASGOW, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Negotiators closed a deal setting rules for carbon markets at the United NationsCOP26 climate talks on Saturday, potentially unlocking trillions of dollars for protecting forests, building renewable energy facilities and other projects to combat climate change.
The final deal adopted by nearly 200 countries will implement Article 6 of the 2015 Paris Agreement , allowing countries to partially meet their climate targets by buying offset credits representing emission cuts by others.
Companies, as well as countries with vast forest cover, had pushed for a robust deal on government-led carbon markets in Glasgow, in the hope of also legitimising the fast-growing global voluntary offset markets.

Critics worry that offsetting could go too far in allowing countries to continue emitting climate-warming gases, making some wary of a hasty deal.
The deal was ""a Brazilian victory"" and the country is gearing up to become a ""big exporter"" of carbon credits, its environment ministry said on social media. The country is home to much of the Amazon forest, and has huge potential to build wind and solar plants .
""It should spur investment and the development of projects that could deliver significant emissions reductions,"" Brazil's chief negotiator Leonardo Cleaver de Athayde told Reuters.
But nations most vulnerable to the effects of climate signaled concern over offsets possibly opening up for abuses allowing bad actors to avoid cutting emissions.
""On Article 6, we will need to remain vigilant against greenwashing,"" the Marshall Islands' Climate Envoy Tina Stege said in a statement.
DISAGREEMENTS OVERCOME
The accord managed to overcome a series of sticking points that contributed to the failure of the previous two major climate meetings.
Previously, there was disagreement over a tax on certain carbon trades intended to fund climate adaptation in poorer nations. The deal addressed this with a compromise that had a two-track approach.
Bilateral trades of offsets between countries will not face the tax. The deal suggests developing nations capitulated to rich nations demands, including the United States, which had objected the levy.
In a separate centralised system for issuing offsets, 5% of proceeds from offsets will be collected to go toward an adaptation fund for developing countries.
Also in that system, 2% of the offset credits will be cancelled. That aims to increase overall emissions cuts by stopping other countries using those credits as offsets to reach their climate targets.
Another provision resolved how to carry forward carbon credits created under the old Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement's predecessor, into the new offset market system.
Negotiators reached a compromise that sets a cut-off date, with credits issued before that date not being carried forward.
The final accord carries over any offsets registered since 2013. That will allow 320 million offsets, each representing a tonne of CO2, to enter the new market, according to an analysis by the NewClimate Institute and Oko-Institut non-profit organisations.
Campaigners had warned against flooding the new market with old credits, and raised doubts about the climate benefits of some.
The 2013 date ""is not good. So now it will be buyer countries' jobs to just say 'no' to them,"" said carbon markets expert Brad Schallert, with the World Wildlife Fund.
DOUBLE COUNTING
One of the most contentious points had been on the question of whether credits could be claimed by both the country selling them and the country buying.
A proposal by Japan resolved the issue and gained backing from both Brazil and the United States. Brazil's past insistence on allowing double counting had torpedoed an Article 6 deal in the past.
Under the deal, the country that generates a credit will decide whether to authorise it for sale to other nations or to count towards their climate targets.
If authorised and sold, the seller country will add an emission unit to its national tally and the buyer country will deduct one, to ensure the emissions cut is counted only once between countries.
The same rules apply to credits used more broadly toward ""other international mitigation purposes"" - wording that some experts said could include a global scheme for offsetting aviation emissions, ensuring double counting does not happen there too.
Matt Williams, a climate expert at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said the final deal was better but not perfect.
""We've seen the worst possibilities for double counting of emissions cuts tightened up or guarded against. It doesn't mean it's ruled out completely.""

EDF review of credit protocols finds inconsistencies with measurement, reporting and verification of net climate impact
July 26, 2021

Dr. Heather Goldstone, (508)-444-1553, hgoldstone@woodwellclimate.org
(WASHINGTON, DC) Credits for soil carbon sequestration currently lack comparability and consistency, which creates uncertainty in soil carbon markets. Efforts are underway, however, to improve the quality of credits and help realize the full greenhouse gas mitigation potential of agricultural soils.
In a new report — Agricultural Soil Carbon Credits: Making sense of protocols for carbon sequestration and net greenhouse gas removals — Environmental Defense Fund and the Woodwell Climate Research Center reviewed the 12 published protocols used to generate soil carbon credits through carbon sequestration in croplands. The protocols take different approaches to measuring, reporting and verifying net climate impacts, and to managing the vital issues of additionality, reversal and permanence. The result is a confusing credit marketplace where it is difficult to compare credits or guarantee climate benefits have been achieved.
“As addressing climate change becomes ever more urgent, we’re seeing a gold rush of investment in soil carbon credits. The stakes for the climate and farmers are extraordinarily high,” said Emily Oldfield , lead report author and agricultural soil carbon scientist at EDF. “Agricultural soils could remove 4-6% of annual U.S. emissions. We need credible, consistent and cost-effective measurement and verification to know with confidence that soil carbon credits are moving us toward that target.”
Public and private sector efforts are underway to improve measurement technologies and methods and to set unified standards for high-quality agricultural carbon credits that accurately represent carbon sequestration and net greenhouse gas removals.
“Congress has the opportunity to pass the Growing Climate Solutions Act and direct the U.S. Department of Agriculture to do what is so clearly needed: set guidelines for high-quality agricultural carbon credits,” said Callie Eideberg , director of agricultural policy for EDF. “USDA must be ready to swiftly implement the bill when it becomes law to increase certainty that markets deliver for farmers and the environment.”
“Businesses face intense pressure to reduce emissions at the pace and scale that the science demands,” said Katie Anderson , senior manager for EDF+Business. “Companies must focus on reducing emissions from their own operations and supply chains, as well as investing in high-quality carbon credits. But, it’s crucial that both soil and forest carbon credits have environmental integrity, guidelines for use and that they’re integrated into a clear pathway to decarbonization.”
Soil carbon remains difficult to measure for a variety of reasons. While scientists understand how soil carbon responds to farm management changes, scientists can’t currently predict the amount and longevity of new carbon sequestration on all farms. Detecting soil carbon changes over time requires a high number of samples, which are costly to collect and analyze, and may need to be collected from different soil depths depending on soil type and conservation practices used.
“There are exciting new research efforts and technological developments underway that will greatly reduce the cost of verifying soil carbon credits,” said Jonathan Sanderman , contributing report author and associate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center. “Increasing accuracy at scale, while also being able to pass on most of the value of a carbon credit to the farmer, is critical to ensuring functioning carbon markets.”
Agricultural soils can contribute meaningfully to climate mitigation and resilience efforts. Once guidelines and standardization between protocols are in place, the enthusiasm for soil carbon credits can be channeled productively toward slowing the rate of climate change and adapting to impacts that are already here. This will benefit both farmers and the planet.

Kyoto Protocol
Scientific background
Climate change is the biggest threat that humanity has ever faced. Warming of the troposphere as a result of releasing man-made greenhouse gases into the atmosphere was predicted as long ago as 1896 .
Levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere have been measured continuously since 1958 at the Mauna Lao Observatory in Hawaii. CO2 has risen from a pre-industrial level of 280 parts per million (ppm) to 415 ppm (2021). Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas and has risen from a pre-industrial level of 722 parts per billion to 1,866 (2019). Methane levels plateaued in the ’90s, but have started rising again since 2008 as shown by the observatory at Baring Head in New Zealand.

This has alarmed scientists who are, as yet, unsure as to the cause(s). Studies by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) favour a fossil fuel origin, and it is certainly true that the rise coincides with increased gas extraction globally, notably fracking. Other authorities favour tropical wetlands, but it is difficult to separate this from agricultural sources such as rice production in paddy fields, or methane released by ruminants such as sheep, cattle and goats. The latest data presented by Hinrich Schaefer at the first Mayday C4 Conference in London (May 1-3, 2021) indicates that agriculture is contributing significantly to these methane increases. Lurking in the background is the certainty that large quantities of methane will be released from thawing permafrost as temperatures in the Arctic continue to increase. An even more catastrophic scenario is the release of methane from the Arctic seabed where roughly 500 billion tonnes is stored in the form of clathrates. In 2013 , Peter Wadhams and his colleagues from Cambridge University predicted that the release of just 50 billion tonnes from the East Siberian Ice Shelf would raise global temperatures by 0.6 degrees Centigrade (C). In October 2020 , scientists reported significant methane releases from this precise area of the Arctic Ocean where the continental shelf is only 30 metres below the surface. Scientists are unsure whether this is a new phenomenon or whether they are observing something that has been happening for many years; other observers regard this event as signalling the start of irreversible climate change .
An even more catastrophic scenario is the release of methane from the Arctic seabed where roughly 500 billion tonnes is stored in the form of clathrates.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) does not include release of methane from the Arctic seabed in their climate projections, as they regard it as a “high impact, low probability event.” This approach may need to be revisited.
In the late ’70s, the US Government asked the Jason Committee to advise on global warming. The committee concluded that a doubling of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere would lead to a rise of temperature to 2–3 degrees Centigrade. However, the committee did not make policy recommendations, and there is considerable dispute as to why nothing more was done at that time.
Global temperatures are monitored and measured by a number of different organisations and these have generated a number of data sets that are in remarkable agreement. The latest findings show that temperature increases are not evenly distributed across the surface of the planet. Air heats up quicker than water, so air temperatures over land are rising quicker than sea surface temperatures. Because most of the Earth’s land mass is located in the Northern hemisphere, temperatures in the North are higher than the South. The greatest temperature changes are being witnessed at the poles as the melting of sea-ice allows greater heat absorption by the oceans. Thus, whilst the average global temperature has increased since 1850 by only 1.2°C worldwide, over Europe the increase is 2°C, and in the Arctic, it is more than 3°C since 1900.
Air heats up quicker than water, so air temperatures over land are rising quicker than sea surface temperatures. Because most of the Earth’s land mass is located in the Northern hemisphere, temperatures in the North are higher than the South.
Other phenomena not previously witnessed are afflicting the Arctic region including progressive thinning of the sea-ice, record-breaking loss of sea-ice during the summer, temperature fluctuations up to 30°C above the seasonal average, and wildfires within the Arctic Circle. These not only release carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, they also darken the snow leading to loss of albedo, and further heat absorption.
Another IPCC prediction that is proving to be overly cautious is melting of the ice-caps; four trillion tonnes of ice has been lost from Greenland since 1990, and a trillion tonnes in the past four years. Currently, ice is melting at 8,500 metric tonnes per second, a rate of loss that was not supposed to occur until 2040 according to the IPCC. Much of the sea-level rise (SLR) that has occurred thus far is due to thermal expansion of the oceans, but it is apparent that ice-cap melting will contribute an increasing percentage of SLR. The following is an original
graph showing data from 1750 to the present day prepared by Professor Philip Woodworth at the National Oceanography Centre in Liverpool.
Source: The National Oceanography centre in Liverpool
It is significant that the mean SLR since 1900 is 1.7 millimetres per annum (mmpa), but since 1993, this has increased to 3.2 mmpa. This process can only end badly for coastal cities and low-lying areas such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, and the Nile delta, not to mention Pacific islands whose average height above sea level is less than 2 metres. It should be recognised that sea levels do not need to flood communities before towns or cities are abandoned. Storm surges and increasingly frequent or ferocious hurricanes will persuade communities to move long before the sea actually reaches their front door, as Storms Katrina and Sandy demonstrated in New Orleans and New York.
The mean sea-level rise since 1900 is 1.7 millimetres per annum (mmpa), but since 1993, this has increased to 3.2 mmpa.
Approximately 10 percent of the world’s population live in coastal communities that are less than 10 metres above sea level, so the number of displaced persons could approach 1 billion.
Political background 
This year the UK Government will host the 26th Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, in Glasgow from 1-12 November inclusive. The President is Alok Sharma, Secretary of State at BEIS, but there is also a COP26 Cabinet Committee chaired by the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, whose stated purpose is to “oversee arrangements for COP 26.” This division of responsibility could cause problems if areas of responsibility are not clearly demarcated.
Another organisation which without a clearly defined hierarchical structure is Extinction Rebellion (XR), which exploded onto the scene in 2018 with a series of eye-catching demonstrations in Central London and elsewhere. At the same time, Greta Thunberg started a protest outside of her school in Sweden. These two events achieved in one year what 30 years of lobbying and hundreds of other environmental groups had conspicuously failed to do, which was to move global warming up the political agenda.
XR has been wrongly accused of being a terrorist organisation. In reality, it is a global movement that believes in and practices non-violent direct action and civil disobedience, an approach that has was advocated by leaders such as Nelson Mandela, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, luminaries of civil rights movements whom one imagines, even the current Home Secretary does not regard as terrorists.
The best way of achieving those goals is to make COP26 a resounding success because, until now, every COP event has been a failure.
XR have been frustrated by the COVID-19 pandemic, but it has also allowed time for reflection as to what tactics will be most effective in the run-up to COP26. The incident at Channing town underground station in 2019 , where a protestor was dragged from the roof of a tube train, has served as a wake-up call for XR, and a recognition that disruptive tactics that prevent people from getting back to work, or even putting their lives back in order post-COVID could backfire badly.
The potential for repeated confrontations between XR demonstrators and the forces of law and order are obvious, and would defeat the purpose of XR’s primary purpose: To find a solution to global warming and to prevent climate breakdown and societal collapse. The best way of achieving those goals is to make COP26 a resounding success because, until now, every COP event has been a failure. We need COP26 to be different if we are to have any chance of saving ourselves and most other species from extinction.
GHG emissions
The graph below shows greenhouse gas emissions over a 40-year period, from 1970–2010. In 1990, the base-line year for Kyoto, GHG emissions totalled 38 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) world-wide. By 2010, this had risen to 49 billion CO2e of which only 65 percent (31.6 billion tonnes) was due to CO2 emissions from energy production and other industrial activities such as cement manufacture. CO2 emissions from agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU) accounted for another 11 percent. Other greenhouse gases such as methane (16 percent), nitrous oxide (6 percent) and trace gases such as halocarbons (2 percent) represented the remaining 24 percent. In 2019, industrial emissions of CO2 peaked at 36.6 billion tonnes, which indicates that total GHGs were slightly over 56 billion tonnes of CO2e, a figure that is seldom discussed by politicians or the media as they are not published on an annual basis.
In order to limit global warming to the preferred limit of 1.5℃ agreed in Paris in 2015, the IPCC estimate that reductions of 7.7 percent are required every year over the coming decade.
Industrial emissions of CO2 in 2020 have fallen by 2.4 billion tonnes due to the COVID pandemic but that is only equivalent to a reduction of 7 percent. In order to limit global warming to the preferred limit of 1.5℃ agreed in Paris in 2015, the IPCC estimate that reductions of 7.7 percent are required every year over the coming decade. The only government to recognise this requirement is the Scottish government that has announced its intention of reducing carbon emissions by 75 percent by 2030 compared with 1990. Joe Biden has offered only 50 percent by 2030, and that is from a 2005 base-line, making the target easier to achieve.
There are two further concerns that are worrying the scientific community. Firstly, due to the thermal inertia of the oceans, we are already well beyond the 1.5℃ limit because there is another 0.6℃ of “committed warming” built into the atmosphere if GHG levels stay at their present level. Recent modelling demonstrates that if all GHG emissions stop tomorrow (a rather preposterous scenario) OR if we found an energy efficient way to capture carbon directly from the atmosphere, then it might be possible to keep temperature rises below 1.5℃.
The other major concern is that temperatures are rising more rapidly than predicted. A paper published in Nature in 2018, predicted that we will reach 1.5 degrees of warming by 2030, rather than the IPCC estimate of 2040.

The deviation from IPCC forecasts is partly due to rapidly rising methane and possibly a reduction in sulphur emissions from power stations and shipping. Lower sulphur emissions rapidly result in lower concentration of sulphate aerosols in the atmosphere, which normally exert a cooling effect. It is difficult to prove this as the Republican leader of the Ways and Means Committee refused funding for NASA in the 1990s to put sulphate monitoring equipment on their satellites.
The deviation from IPCC forecasts is partly due to rapidly rising methane and possibly a reduction in sulphur emissions from power stations and shipping.
However, temperatures have confounded even the authors of this paper. In 2020, we reached 1.2℃ of warming. The World Meteorological Organisation forecast in June 2021 that there was a 90 percent chance of breaching 1.5C of warming before 2026.
Conclusion 
It is obvious that the Kyoto Protocol has proven a political failure. Annual CO2 emissions have risen by 60 percent since 1990, and more anthropogenic CO2 has been emitted since 1990 than in all the previous years going back to the start of the Indutrial Revolution. The world community cannot hope to get a grip on this situation without finding a way of putting a price on carbon; and this leads us to the next stage: The Global Carbon Incentive Fund. Meanwhile, we absolutely must do everything in our power to make COP26 a success, and that means every country in the world recognising the extreme urgency of the climate situation. As I wrote in a Lancet editorial published in April 1989 : “The costs may be considerable, but the costs of doing nothing are incalculable”.

There are enough of the chemicals remaining in the atmosphere to cause some serious ozone damage, and it will get worse if greenhouse gas concentrations increase and continue cooling the the stratosphere above the Arctic, said Markus Rex, co-author of the research published today in Nature Communications , and leader of the MOSAiC expedition in 2019 and 2020. 
“There are plenty of good reasons to quickly and comprehensively reduce greenhouse-gas emissions,” he said. “Now we can add the risk of intensified ozone depletion over the Arctic to the list.”
The measurements from the MOSAiC research “really helps nail down” the region’s declining ozone, he said. “Ozone depletion takes place within the polar vortex. It’s like a pot in which things happen, and you have to be there in the central Arctic in March and April to see them happen. Typically, nobody is in the central Arctic during that season.”
Arctic Ozone Decline Could Offset the Montreal Protocol’s Gains
Arctic researchers first started tracking ozone loss in 2005, then recorded colder and colder stratospheric temperatures in 2011, 2016 and again in 2020, with “larger and larger ozone losses,” Rex said. “If we follow one of the higher emissions scenarios, the depletion in the Arctic will overrun the gains made under the Montreal Protocol.”
The research shows how the effects of global warming vary regionally, he said.
“People out there on the street say, ‘ozone layer, that used to be a problem, but scientists and politicians have fixed it, now it’s on the way to recovery,’” he said. “That notion is true for part of the globe, but it may be completely wrong for the Arctic.”
During the MOSAiC expedition, Rex said his team was able to track how about “90 to 95 percent of the ozone in the polar vortex was depleted within a few weeks. It was almost completely gone. That has a very strong impact on ultraviolet radiation levels at the ground, with a substantial increase in very sharp, specific periods.”
Atmospheric scientist Neil Harris of Cranfield University (U.K.), who was not involved in the study, said it presents the best evidence to-date of how global warming will affect the temperature of the stratosphere above the Arctic.
“It finds that the Arctic in the 21st century will be more prone to ozone loss than previously thought,” he said. “The levels of ozone depletors is going down, which is good, but this will be offset to a larger degree than previously thought by colder stratospheric winters.”
Ozone is a natural gas in the atmosphere, reaching its greatest concentrations in a layer about 12 to 25 miles high. That layer of the gas blocks more than 90 percent of the sun’s ultraviolet radiation, and is most noticeable through its absence, as with the annual ozone hole centered over Antarctica. 
The 2019 ozone hole over Antarctica was the smallest on record since measurements started in 1982, according to NOAA, which shows that the ozone layer has recovered slightly and shows improvements since 2000. But in just the last few decades, ozone has decreased at times over the Arctic. Monitoring by the MOSAiC researchers and by NASA showed it reaching a record-low level in 2020. The European Space Agency reported on this year’s “unusual” Arctic ozone hole in April, measuring it at about 400,000 square miles. 
Ozone Breakdown can Harm Humans, Ecosystems
Ultraviolet radiation can affect human health, triggering cancer, and also affects domesticated and wild plants by impairing photosynthesis and by reducing the size, productivity and quality in many of the crops that have been studied, including rice, soybeans, winter wheat, cotton and corn. 
Too much ultraviolet light can also affect aquatic systems, impairing cellular division in sea urchin eggs, for example. In the Antarctic, the annual ozone hole can cause at least a 6-12 percent reduction in photosynthesis by phytoplankton in surface waters.
The MOSAiC research showed the lowest Arctic polar vortex temperatures and the highest ozone losses on record in 2020, beating the previous records set in 2011. And looking back at the last 50 years shows that the number of days cold enough to trigger ozone destruction have increased by 40 percent, with more increases ahead if greenhouse gas emissions don’t decrease.

That means there’s a race between the slow and steady decline of ozone-harming chemicals, and global warming, which is causing more extreme cold conditions in the polar vortex high in the atmosphere, said co-author Ross Salawitch , with the University of Maryland Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science.
“The increasingly cold temperatures create conditions that promote ozone depletion by CFCs,” he said. “So, even though these compounds are slowly going away, Arctic ozone depletion is on the rise as the climate changes.” The extreme cold promotes the formation of high clouds, which provide the right conditions for the chlorine to change form and react with bromine and sunlight to destroy ozone, he explained.
Increasing methane, another climate super-pollutant, may also play a role, the scientists said. In the upper levels of the atmosphere, the potent greenhouse gas increases humidity, which also leads to conditions that promote ozone-destroying chemical reactions.
“This paper is really a wake-up call that something is happening in the atmosphere that’s really important for ozone, and it looks like greenhouse gases are driving it,” said Salawitch, who showed in previous studies that extreme winters in the Arctic are becoming colder. 
The data gathered by the MOSAiC research team helps show what will happen in the future. For the study, the research projected ozone loss through 2100 based on past observed trends, projections for temperatures in the stratospheric polar vortex and the expected decline in chlorine and bromine compounds. Nearly all the results showed the polar vortex chilling even more.
And when the projections are combined with the analysis of observed data from the past half century, it confirms that the Arctic is already experiencing a significant trend toward lower stratospheric temperatures and associated increases in ozone losses. 
Francesco Cairo, an atmospheric scientist with the Italian National Research Council, said the new research shows that the Arctic polar vortex may more frequently be stronger and colder, “similar to the Antarctic vortex, where cold and isolated air allows the full unfolding of the actions of the ozone depleting substances.”
What happens in the Arctic won’t stay in the Arctic, at least in regards to ozone, Rex added.
“This represents a fundamental paradigm shift in our assessment of the future of the Arctic ozone layer,” Rex said. “And the future of the Arctic ozone layer is relevant for life in Europe, North America and Asia. The Arctic polar vortex occasionally drifts south, which can lead to a few days with a reduced ozone layer over populated areas in spring, increasing levels of UV radiation and ultimately a greater risk of sunburn and acquiring skin cancer during these periods.”

Climate Research Center reviewed the 12 published protocols used to.,26-Jul-2021,"Soil carbon credits have potential but need clear standards
Guidelines for high-quality credits will help guarantee credits deliver durable climate benefits
Our review of soil carbon credit protocols finds inconsistencies with measurement, reporting and verification of net climate impact.
Published: July 26, 2021
Soil carbon contributes meaningfully to climate mitigation and resilience efforts. Scientists estimate that agricultural soils could remove 4-6% of annual U.S. emissions.
Credits for soil carbon sequestration, however, lack comparability and consistency, which has created uncertainty in the marketplace.
In a new report — Agricultural Soil Carbon Credits: Making sense of protocols for carbon sequestration and net greenhouse gas removals — Environmental Defense Fund and the Woodwell Climate Research Center reviewed the 12 published protocols used to generate soil carbon credits through carbon sequestration in croplands.
Key findings:
Soil carbon protocols take different approaches to measuring, reporting and verifying net climate impacts, and to managing the vital issues of additionality, reversal and permanence. This variation makes it difficult to ensure climate benefits have been achieved.
Until these variations can be resolved, paying farmers to sequester soil carbon will remain an uncertain approach to greenhouse gas mitigation but can still deliver important benefits for climate resilience, soil health and water quality.
Soil carbon sequestration can become an important mitigation strategy if there is agreed upon, credible, cost effective and consistent measurement, reporting and verification behind the credits.
Progress toward high-quality soil carbon credits:
Congress can pass the  Growing Climate Solutions Act to direct the U.S. Department of Agriculture to set guidelines for high-quality agricultural carbon credits and make it easier for farmers to participate in carbon markets.
Companies can double down on efforts to reduce emissions from their own operations and invest in high-quality carbon credits, such as those that prevent tropical deforestation .
Researchers can advance technology that will make it easier to measure soil carbon levels over time and more cost-effective to verify carbon credits.

COP architects furious at lack of climate justice at pivotal summit
Scientists who worked on the original UN climate convention doubt that COP26 will deliver for low income countries.

Researchers who helped to draft parts of the first United Nations environmental agreements nearly 30 years ago say that that low income countries are being massively let down in the current COP26 climate talks.
The 1992 UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was attended by scientists and policymakers from rich and poor countries. “I was so hopeful,” says ecologist Zakri Abdul Hamid, who was the scientific adviser to Malaysia’s delegation, as he recalls how he “morphed from a straight-laced young academic” to a scientific policymaker.
“I had high hopes in Rio,” adds Saleemul Huq, a climate scientist from Bangladesh who was an adviser to climate-vulnerable countries attending Rio.
COP26 climate pledges: What scientists think so far
The summit led to UN agreements to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss, and a new UN focus on sustainable development. But Zakri now thinks he was “naive” to expect wealthy nations to keep their promises to protect the interests of poorer countries.
As the second week of negotiations at the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) gets under way in Glasgow, UK, low-income nations are deeply critical about the slow pace of decarbonization, and say that pledges to deliver funding have not been honoured.
Landmark agreement
Rio was a significant meeting because policymakers from rich and poor countries settled on what seemed to be an equitable formula to protect the environment from the worst effects of industrialization. The ideas that led to the summit had largely come from high-income countries. Lower income nations were concerned that a climate-change or biodiversity agreement would prevent them from building their own industries and modern infrastructure.
In response, richer countries agreed to take on the burden of decarbonizing and reducing biodiversity loss, while giving poorer countries more time to industrialize. But they have not done this, says Zakri, who went on to chair the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.
In a report published ahead of COP26, researchers at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) in New Delhi worked out that between 1990 and 2019, the highest-income countries were responsible for two-thirds of greenhouse-gas emissions . Wealthy nations also failed to abide by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, an international law to reduce emissions by an average of 5% from 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.
COP26 climate summit: A scientists’ guide to a momentous meeting
From the early 1990s onwards, ‘contraction and convergence’ gained popularity as a way to boost equity. The idea was that high- and low-income countries would both decarbonize, but at different rates — with richer countries cutting emissions more quickly (‘contraction’) — until emissions from the two groups converged on the same per-capita level. The idea soon attracted influential policymakers from both high- and low-income countries, including China and the United States, as well as from UN agencies.
“It offended no-one; it united everyone. It is equitable. It is inclusive,” says the idea’s principal architect, Aubrey Meyer at the Global Commons Institute in London. But this support for the concept failed to translate into meaningful action.
“Today, 30 years later at COP26, most environmental problems have worsened,” says Zakri, and richer nations have not been held to account.
Sunita Narain is director-general of the CSE and co-authored its report with climate-policy specialist Avantika Goswami. Narain says the 2015 Paris climate deal — the agreement to limit global warming to below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels — has ended up weakening commitments to equity. Since the agreement was signed, lower-income countries are also expected to start to reduce their emissions. Yet these countries produce a fraction of the greenhouse gases of the big emitters, she says.
“The reality is that Paris has not given us the space to grow,” says Narain, who was at the Rio summit representing CSE. She worries that pledges from the large emitters to achieve net-zero emissions by or after 2050 will enable richer countries to “continue to take more of the carbon budget”, unless strict interim targets are enforced.
Funding failure
The Rio veterans are also furious about broken promises on climate finance. The 1992 deal stipulated that richer countries would provide funding to protect climate-vulnerable countries from the effects of global warming, and to help them to develop new technologies.
The broken $100-billion promise of climate finance – and how to fix it
A $1 billion fund called the Global Environment Facility was established, and this would be followed by other modest climate funding pots. At COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009, richer nations agreed on a more realistic figure that would match the needs of low and middle income countries: they promised to provide US$100 billion a year from 2020 to 2025 . The 2020 target was missed, and more than two-thirds of the funding that has been given is in the form of loans, not the “new and additional finance” that was expected after Rio, says Tariq Banuri, a former director of sustainable development at the UN in New York, who represented Pakistan at the 1992 Earth Summit.
Banuri says the COP negotiation process that he, Huq, Zakri, Narain and others helped to create is now not much more than “institutional therapy” for the richer countries. “They are engaging in a failed process to reassure themselves that they are doing something. I am very pessimistic about the COP,” he says.
At the same time, there’s a consensus that hope must not die.Large numbers of scientists and young people from science, activism and policy are present for the COP in Glasgow. “They must continue to speak truth to power,” Narain says.
Huq, who founded the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Dhaka, says countries must continue to work through the UN, collaboratively, to get justice. “The United Nations is the closest thing the world has to a global governance body,” he says. “We have to persevere with it, even though it isn’t really delivering.”

New Sustainable Mining Standard to place Canadian Mining Industry at the Forefront of Global Climate Efforts
OTTAWA, ON, May 5, 2021 /CNW/ - Today, the Mining Association of Canada (MAC) is releasing a new Towards Sustainable Mining ® (TSM) Climate Change Protocol  designed to minimize the mining sector's carbon footprint, while enhancing climate change disclosure and strengthening the sector's ability to adapt to climate change.
""We are committed to being a constructive partner in the fight against climate change. TSM has a proven track record of driving positive change in Canada's mining industry and this new protocol ensures that we will continue to adopt leading practices related to climate change mitigation and adaptation,"" said Pierre Gratton, MAC's President and CEO. ""Our mined materials are required inputs for green technology, like electric vehicle batteries, wind turbines and solar panels, and it is critical that these minerals and metals be responsibly sourced with the smallest GHG footprint possible. As an energy intensive industry, we know we have an important role to play in lessening our carbon footprint, and this new TSM protocol is intended to help our members do just that.""
TSM was the first mining sustainability standard in the world to require site-level assessments and is mandatory for all MAC member companies' Canadian operations. First launched in 2004, TSM is a globally recognized sustainability program that supports mining companies in managing key environmental and social risks. Through TSM, eight critical aspects of social and environmental performance are evaluated, independently validated, and publicly reported against 30 distinct performance indicators. Canada's mining sector operates some of the lowest carbon-intensive mines in the world thanks to Canada's abundance of clean energy, the adoption of world-class sustainability standards like TSM and company adoption of low emission technologies at their sites.
""Not only does the industry have an important role to play in reducing its emissions and adapting to the impacts of climate change, but Canada's mining sector is also uniquely positioned to support the global energy transition that will be required to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement,"" continued Gratton. ""The new TSM Climate Change Protocol truly raises the bar for industry performance related to climate change, ensuring robust corporate governance and strategies related to climate action as well as comprehensive management systems at mine sites to ensure that companies can meet their climate-related targets.""
The TSM Climate Change Protocol is a major update to the TSM Energy Use and GHG Emissions Management Protocol, first introduced in 2013. The Climate Change Protocol is supported by the publication of the new Guide to Climate Change Adaptation for the Mining Sector , a comprehensive, first-of-its-kind guidance for the mining sector focused on assessing and identifying potential physical climate impacts, considering these risks in decision-making, and implementing corresponding adaptation measures. With substantial input from industry and communities of interest, the new protocol responds to many of the calls to action issued to MAC by the Community of Interest Advisory Panel  in Rising To The Challenge: Advisory Statement On Climate Change , published in 2016.
The TSM Climate Change Protocol improves upon the TSM Energy Use and GHG Emissions Protocol in several important ways, including:
Stronger requirements for energy use and GHG emissions management, performance, and reporting at the facility level, setting a new bar for best practice.
A new indicator on climate change management at the corporate level to support companies in responding to the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures and in setting ambitious targets and actions in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement, including commitments related to net-zero emissions by 2050.
Incorporation of new requirements for facility-level management of physical climate-related risks and adaptation measures.
""Climate change is an issue that matters to all of us. Minimizing our industry's environmental footprint also makes good business sense as investors are looking for companies to disclose how they are managing climate-related risks and considering these risks in their business strategies,"" said Gratton. ""This new protocol requires companies to make commitments, set targets and take action consistent with the ambitions of the Paris Agreement and, at higher levels of performance, make commitments corresponding with the societal ambition to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.""
Additional Quotes
""Climate change is both the challenge of our time and the economic opportunity. The mining sector will play a critical role in supplying the minerals and metals for batteries needed in the clean economy and I am pleased to see the actions taken today to do that in a manner that is both responsible and sustainable. This makes good sense for the planet and for the economy.""
-  The Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Canada's Minister of Environment and Climate Change
""We welcome further efforts by the Mining Association of Canada and its members to reduce emissions and prepare Canada's mining sector to compete globally in supplying the metals and minerals necessary for a net zero transition. We have a window of opportunity to create a value chain that uses Canadian metals/minerals to support battery and electric vehicle production in Canada. Action now is critical to seize this opportunity and the Climate Change Protocol is an important step."" 
-  Mark Zacharias, Special Advisor, Clean Energy Canada
""We welcome the release of the Mining Association of Canada's new Climate Change Protocol. Assessing and managing the opportunities and risks presented by climate change is core to making informed investment decisions on behalf of our clients. The Towards Sustainable Mining framework provides investors with consistent and independently verified performance assessments against clear climate governance and disclosure expectations.""
-  Daniel Garant, Executive Vice President and Global Head, Public Markets, BCI
""While we believe metals and minerals are critical to transitioning to a low carbon economy, the mining sector will need to join others in embracing aggressive climate targets to pursue the objective that those materials are produced at the lowest carbon intensity possible.  We welcome TSM's new Climate Change Protocol as a step in the right direction to drive de-carbonization and align climate actions and disclosure with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures.""
-  Margaret Childe, Head of ESG, Public Markets, Canada, Manulife Investment Management
""As the world faces a state of climate emergency those most responsible for the creation of GHG emissions are obligated to reduce them as fast as possible for the common good and the sustainability of the planet. Governments and citizens have their work to do, but the industrial sector has an enormous role and opportunity to help society get to net-zero at least by 2050, or before. Mining companies must reduce their own footprint substantially and help advance the just transition that is necessary if we are to hold global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. When the COI Panel called for MAC to act more decisively on climate change we saw the urgency for committed action on mitigation, adaptation, and assessing climate risk by the private sector, and mining companies in particular. We are seeing the shift in awareness and uptake of needed actions beginning. Canadians and people around the world are now demanding stronger measures. Hopefully the new TSM Climate Change Protocol will clearly demonstrate that real action for change today is possible and necessary.""
-  Joy Kennedy, former COI Panel Member and co-author of the 2016 COI Panel Advisory Statement, Rising to the Challenge

Under the Kigali Amendment, Chinese chemical companies must stop emitting a super-pollutant called HFC-23. The challenges are enormous.

China began enforcing the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol last week—and the climate implications are huge.
The agreement requires China and other signatory nations to slash the production and use of powerful greenhouse gases known as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) over the coming decades, and to immediately stop emitting the most potent, HFC-23, a greenhouse gas that is 14,600 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in warming the atmosphere.
HFC-23 is an unwanted byproduct of the production of hydrochlorofluorocarbon-22 (HCFC-22), a chemical used as a refrigerant and a component in Teflon and other products. 
Unlike carbon dioxide, which cannot be easily broken down, HFC-23 can be destroyed at relatively little cost through incineration, offering a rare opportunity to quickly address climate change at a fraction of the cost of other methods aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions.

But an estimated 15,900 tons of HFC-23 are still being released into the atmosphere each year, equal to the annual greenhouse gas emissions of 50 million automobiles. Eliminating emissions of HFC-23 and other HFCs could prevent half a degree of additional warming by the end of the century. 
Now comes the hard part for China, given its current rank as the world’s largest HFC-23 producer. 
The task of reducing emissions will be complicated by the fact that some Chinese chemical companies may have failed to comply with the country’s previous requirements for incinerating HFC-23, and by the country’s rapidly growing sector of new HCFC-22 producers, according to a review by Inside Climate News of United Nations documents, Chinese government reports and company records.
Experts in China and the United States also cited ambiguity in the Kigali Amendment itself and said in interviews that, even under the best circumstances, monitoring the plants in China’s sprawling chemical industry that produce HCFC-22 and its byproduct, HFC-23, will be difficult. 
The Montreal Protocol was negotiated in 1987 to address the ozone hole over Antarctica by phasing out the production of ozone depleting chemicals. The Kigali Amendment was added to the Protocol in 2016 to phase down the production and use of HFCs, to help address climate change.
“You could have very good regulations, you could be part of the Kigali amendment, you could be doing everything you think as a government you can possibly do, but your efforts are going to be on paper only if there isn’t a robust monitoring, reporting, verification and enforcement program that goes along with it,” said Avipsa Mahapatra, climate campaign lead with the Environmental Investigation Agency, a nonprofit environmental organization based in Washington.
Monitoring Challenges
A study published last year in the journal Nature Communications found that global HFC-23 emissions were higher than ever in 2018, the most recent year for which data is available. 
Kieran Stanley, a climate scientist at the University of Bristol, and his co-authors couldn’t say definitively where the emissions were coming from. They suggested that China was the most likely source, but a June report by the United Nations Environment Program challenged that assertion.  
A global monitoring network, administered by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and another international effort known as the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment, detect emissions of HFC-23 and other potent greenhouse gases or ozone depleting substances controlled under the Montreal Protocol. However, these monitoring networks can’t detect regional emissions from vast swaths of the planet, including much of China.   
A new atmospheric study that builds on the work of the 2020 Nature Communications research is now in the works, focusing on regional emissions from East Asia, although its findings may be limited by the challenges in monitoring.  
“There are major gaps in monitoring capability and data availability, throughout much of the world,” said Alex Hillbrand, an HFC specialist with the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington.  “It is concerning to me that we’re heading into a period of time with an HFC phase down and immediate HFC-23 destruction requirements in which we’re quite limited in what we can do atmospherically to make sure that all the reports are up to snuff.” 
How a UN Program Became a ‘Perverse Incentive’
The United Nations first targeted HFC-23 emissions in China in 2006, when a U.N. program known as the Clean Development Mechanism or CDM, began providing incentives to HCFC-22 producers to destroy their HFC-23 emissions. The program paid HCFC-22 producers in China and other developing countries emission reduction credits, which were then traded with developed countries to meet their emission reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol. 
The program’s incentives for reducing HFC-23 emissions were so lucrative, they created a “ perverse incentive.” Producers, the vast majority of them in China, began producing excess HCFC-22, and its byproduct, HFC-23, and doing so as inefficiently as possible, simply so they could then destroy more HFC-23 to earn additional emission reduction credits. 
“These companies made billions of dollars in windfall profit from the sale of carbon credits,” Mahapatra said. “Their main business became generating HFC-23 so they could destroy it, as opposed to their actual other production.”
In response, the European Union, the largest purchaser of CDM credits, stopped funding the program in 2013, causing the price of emission reduction credits to plummet.
Global emissions of HFC-23 quickly exceeded pre-CDM levels. China and India, the second largest producer of HCFC-22, pledged to reduce their HFC-23 emissions, but without a financial incentive for destroying HFC-23, many producers may have begun venting it into the atmosphere instead. 
China’s Voluntary Incentives 
In 2015, China required all companies building new HCFC-22 capacity to abate their HFC-23 emissions and established a voluntary incentive program , encouraging existing producers to destroy their HFC-23 emissions. China funded the program after reaching an agreement with the United Nations under which China would receive more than $350 million to protect atmospheric ozone by reducing HCFC-22 production for direct uses such as refrigerants and foam insulation.  
When released into the atmosphere, HCFC-22 destroys atmospheric ozone, which protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. When HCFC-22 is blended with other chemicals for use as a feedstock for other products, it no longer poses an ozone threat.  
As part of the HCFC-22 deal, China also agreed to “ make best efforts ” to reduce the climate impact of byproduct HFC-23 production, as the country increased production of HCFC-22 as a feedstock for other chemicals.  
Seeking to avoid mistakes made by the Clean Development Mechanism, the Chinese incentive program offered less money for emissions reductions than the CDM and limited eligibility to production facilities completed prior to the program’s implementation.  
U.N. documents, based on reports verified by the World Bank, concluded that the program had been highly successful, eliminating 98 percent of HFC-23 emissions from eleven participating HCFC-22 producers. 
Possible Holes in China’s Efforts
But with almost 16,000 tons of HFC-23 being released into the atmosphere annually, experts consider China a likely source for a considerable percentage of that total. 
Ten companies in China either built new HCFC-22 capacity after April 2015 or are currently building new production facilities, meaning they were never covered by the government’s incentive program, according to government records, company announcements and Chinese media accounts. 
In addition, three of the producers participating in the incentive program have expanded or are in the process of expanding their HCFC-22 production capacity, according to company documents. The expansions occured after 2015 and were therefore not eligible to earn subsidies for HFC-23 destruction. 
These 13 additional plants or expansions built after 2015 that were not part of China’s subsidy program will have a total capacity of 411,400 tons-per-year of HCFC-22, if all construction is completed, according to an analysis by Inside Climate News. While most of the additional capacity has probably been completed, Inside Climate News could not verify the status of all the construction projects. 
Assuming these facilities operate at the same utilization rate and produce the same percent of waste HFC-23 as plants that were part of the subsidy program, these 13 chemical plants could generate approximately 9,200 tons of HFC-23, assuming all facilities are completed. 
Those emissions would equal 58 percent of the 15,900 tons of HFC-23 emissions in the atmosphere reported in the 2020 Nature Communications study, or the equivalent annual greenhouse gas emissions of 29 million automobiles. 
The potential for unreported HCFC-22 production in China would not be unprecedented. The Chinese government disclosed two instances of illegal, un-permitted production of HCFC-22 that it identified and reportedly shut down, one in 2013 and another in 2014 . 
Similarly, widespread illegal production of CFC-11, a potent greenhouse gas and ozone depleting substance used to make foam insulation, was recently uncovered in China through on the ground investigations by the Environmental Investigation Agency and the New York Times , as well as scientific studies . CFC-11 is banned under the Montreal Protocol.
Following the recent discovery of illegal CFC-11 production in China, Stanley and his co-authors wrote in their 2020 Nature Communications study that “we cannot exclude the possibility that there is substantial, unreported production of HCFC-22 from which HFC-23 is vented” in China.
The Likelihood of Abatement
China may not be a significant source of HFC-23 emissions. It’s possible that the additional facilities and expansions outside China’s incentive program have been incinerating their emissions. A 2019 U.N. Environment Program report states that all HCFC-22 plants in China collectively prevented 99.8 percent of the HFC-23 they generated from entering the atmosphere in 2018. The figure is even higher than the 98 percent figure UNEP cites for the 11 Chinese plants that received subsidies to abate.  
However, a 2020 assessment of the HFC-23 emissions destruction subsidy program, authored by researchers from China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment concluded that new HCFC-22 production facilities and expansions that were not eligible to receive incentives for destroying HFC-23 are a “potential source of emissions” that “merit attention.” 
Companies that built new capacity after 2015 were required to destroy their HFC-23 emissions without receiving incentives to do so. However, the requirement was part of a “circular” issued by the environment ministry that carries less weight than an official regulation.
“Under this circular, you report but there isn’t any real verification,” Hu Jianxin, professor of environmental science and engineering at China’s Peking University, told Inside Climate News. “The companies reported they incinerated, but whether they actually did, it is very hard for us to confirm.” 
Inside Climate News spoke to representatives of four producers that did not receive subsidies. They all declined to comment.   
The Situation After Chinese Incentives Ended in 2019
In any case, because incentives for incinerating HFC-23 emissions ceased for everyone at the end of 2019, which incentive category a Chinese chemical company falls into doesn’t really matter. Without new subsidies or regulations replacing the old incentives, scientists and experts said that HFC-23 emissions may have soared in 2020, as they did in 2014 after funding for the UN’s incentive program dried up.  
The prior CDM incentive program and the more recent subsidy program administered by the Chinese government were an important source of motivation for companies, according to Han Wei, the industry program deputy director for Energy Foundation China, a nonprofit with offices in San Francisco and Beijing that funds projects addressing climate change in China.   
The 2020 study on China’s emissions destruction subsidy program, authored by the environment ministry researchers, warned that without a new HFC-23 policy after the subsidies ended in 2019, there would be a lot of “uncertainty” about future emissions reduction. The authors of the report did not respond to a request for comment. 
Peking University’s Hu put it more plainly: With no new incentives in place, “2020 was a year without regulation,” he said. 
Hu’s team at Peking University recently conducted a survey of China’s HCFC-22 producers, asking if they had destroyed HFC-23 in 2020. Most of the companies said they had, however one said it had not. In addition, two HCFC-22 companies did not have incinerators in 2020, making it unlikely that they destroyed HFC-23, according to a document published by the environment ministry in August. 
“I believe that some companies definitely did incinerate,” Hu said. “For the other companies, verification is needed to confirm that they really incinerated, even though they reported they did.”
One of the Least Expensive Ways to Reduce Greenhouse Gases 
Whatever the level of compliance in China, the Kigali Amendment holds great promise for combating climate change. It would cost approximately $46 million per year to destroy the estimated 15,900 metric tons of HFC-23 emitted globally in 2018, according to a recent cost assessment prepared for the United Nations Environment Program . The figures are based on costs at HCFC-22 production facilities with existing incinerators in eastern China, where two-thirds of the world’s HCFC-22 is produced.  
The carbon dioxide equivalent of 15,900 tons of HFC-23 is 232 million tons of carbon dioxide. Destroying HFC-23 for roughly $50 million per year would make it one of the least expensive ways to eliminate a large volume of greenhouse gas emissions.  
By comparison, Vineyard Wind, the first large-scale offshore wind farm in the United States, now being built off Massachusetts, will offset 1.6 million tons of carbon dioxide per year at a cost of $93 million per year, spread over the expected 30-year life of the project. 
In other words, the annual destruction of all of the world’s HFC-23 emissions could be done at roughly half the cost, and provide more than 100 times the climate benefit, as building a single offshore wind farm.  
Simply throwing money at HFC-23 emissions will not solve the problem, as the prior Clean Development Mechanism, with it’s spurring of additional HCFC-22 and HFC-23 production has shown. Yet the chemical’s outsized climate impact and the dramatic emissions reductions that can be achieved through incineration make curbing HFC-23 emissions a top priority for climate advocates.   
“It’s criminal not to abate it immediately and completely,” Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, an environmental advocacy group based in Washington, said. “It’s easy to abate. It’s cheap to abate. We all know how to do it. And when you don’t do it, you’re causing irreparable harm to the climate system, for what may be centuries to millennia.”
Scant Details on How to Implement and Monitor Kigali Compliance
Since Sept. 15, when China officially entered the Kigali Amendment, all Chinese HCFC-22 producers are required to immediately destroy HFC-23.
The Chinese environment ministry released a new circular to implement the Kigali Amendment on Sept. 14, laying out that requirement. The circular does not contain details about how companies should submit their emissions reduction data or how the environment ministry will verify emissions reductions, but the Chinese government is expected to provide more clarity soon, advocates said. 
“In the near future, MEE is working with stakeholders to research detailed policies and measures on controlling HFCs and HFC-23, to improve the overall management of these substances under the Montreal Protocol,” said Han, of Energy Foundation China. 
Chinese chemical manufacturers have also been working on methods to break down HFC-23 into other useful chemical compounds. Such recycling, while still under development, could provide a market incentive, rather than a government incentive, to stop venting the gas. 
At the same time, the Chinese government has stated that it will launch a national atmospheric and local monitoring network to track HFCs in the coming years. 
Even with more detailed regulations, some experts question whether measures to eliminate HFC-23 will be effective, given the ambiguity of the Kigali Amendment itself.

The text of the amendment reads that HFC-23 must be destroyed “to the extent practicable,” and existing incinerators and other devices can destroy more than 99.9 percent of HFC-23.
Still, some environmental advocates fear that the wording could give producers in China—and elsewhere—enough wiggle room to evade full implementation of pollution controls. China’s MEE notice, for example, does not state exactly what percentage of emissions companies must abate, although more detailed rules will be forthcoming.
“Under the [Kigali] agreement, companies have to destroy HFC-23 ‘to the extent practicable,’ but there is no specific level given,” Han said. “We believe that if we want to control HFC-23, for companies, a specific target is definitely needed.”
It also remains to be seen if data from the Chinese monitoring network, which could play a key role in ensuring that Chinese producers destroy all of their HFC-23, will be made publicly available.
With the impacts of climate change already upon us, Zaelke said, we can no longer afford any errors with HFC-23 emission reductions. 
“The world has made serious mistakes in trying to regulate HFC-23 over the last couple of decades and it’s time we got it right,” he said. “That’s going to require constant vigilance.”

An international ban on ozone-depleting chemicals preserved the ozone layer and prevented a significant increase in global warming.

A 1987 worldwide ban on ozone-depleting chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) averted a dangerous rise in the level of ultraviolet radiation (UV) reaching the Earth’s surface.
Without this multilateral environmental agreement, people worldwide would have faced a higher risk of
skin and other cancers
, eye damage, and possible immune system problems due to excess UV rays.
But a new modeling study from UK researchers suggests that the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer also prevented a 2.5°C increase in global warming by the end of the century.
“As well as protecting the ozone layer, the Montreal Protocol has itself been a phenomenally successful climate treaty,” study author Paul Young, PhD, of Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, wrote in a recent post about the research on The Conversation.
“It has controlled not only the emissions of highly potent greenhouse gases like CFCs but, as we have shown, it has avoided additional CO₂ levels through protecting the world’s plant life,” Young said in the article.
in Nature, Young and his colleagues developed a new modeling framework that combined data on ozone depletion, plant damage due to increased UV radiation, the carbon cycle, and climate change.
They looked at three scenarios.
The first is our current situation, with CFCs phased out under the Montreal Protocol. Next is what would have happened if CFCs in the atmosphere had remained at 1960 levels.
Finally is the “world avoided,” which shows what the future would have looked like if CFCs had continued to increase 3 percent each year from the 1970s onward.
Under the last scenario, a continued increase in atmospheric CFCs would have led to ongoing damage to the ozone layer.
This part of the atmosphere shields humans and other life on Earth from harmful levels of ultraviolet radiation from the sun.
The researchers predict that under the “world avoided” scenario, the ozone layer would have collapsed by the 2040s, exposing the planet’s surface to far more UV radiation.
UV rays are harmful not only to people but also to plants. The increase in UV radiation would have caused vast damage to the tissues of plants and restricted their growth.
Plants have many important roles. One of these is storing carbon in their tissues and soils.
The researchers’ model shows that if CFCs had continued to increase, UV damage to plants would have led to hundreds of billions of tons less carbon being stored in forests, other vegetation, and soils by the end of the century.
As a result, the level of CO₂ in the atmosphere would have increased 40 to 50 percent over today’s level — causing an additional 0.8°C of global warming.
CFCs are also potent greenhouse gases. The accumulation of these gases under the “world avoided” scenario would have added another 1.7°C global warming by the end of the century.
This is on top of the increase due to other greenhouse gases and the continued burning of fossil fuels.
Applying lessons from Montreal Protocol to climate change
Edward Parson , PhD, an environmental law expert and a UCLA School of Law professor, said this new study links climate change and ozone depletion in an “impressive and technically sophisticated way.”
“They’ve found another way that the Montreal Protocol and the elimination — or near-elimination — of ozone-depleting chemicals have done huge good for human welfare and the environment,” he said.
Parson is the author of “ Protecting the Ozone Layer: Science and Strategy ,” an account of the international cooperation that led to the Montreal Protocol, published in 2003.
However, he is a “little skeptical” about how the paper’s authors framed their modeling.
The “world avoided” is basically the worst-case scenario — what would have happened if the international community had done nothing to address CFCs.
This assumes that countries wouldn’t have stepped up in some other way.
“If there hadn’t been a Montreal Protocol, there might have been some other controls on ozone-depleting chemicals sooner or later,” said Parson, “because [at the time] the harms were clear, and there was already a lot of momentum toward addressing the problem.”
Still, he says the success of the Montreal Protocol is a “remarkable story,” one that he thinks has lessons to teach us about how to address climate change.
Not everyone agrees.
In Young’s post on The Conversation, he cautioned that the problem tackled by the Montreal Protocol was less cumbersome than addressing greenhouse gases and climate change.
“[W]ith just a handful of companies making CFCs and alternative chemicals readily available, the ozone issue was far more straightforward than reducing emissions from fossil fuels,” he wrote.
Fossil fuels, on the other hand, are intertwined with almost every aspect of the global economy and our lives. It’s difficult to imagine a world without them.
Parson, though, points to one particular lesson from the Montreal Protocol — regulations on CFCs were put in place even before alternative technologies to these chemicals were widely available.
The looming threat of these regulations spurred an extraordinary flood of innovative activity, he said, from both CFC producers and industries that used these chemicals.
“There are real possibilities of deploying some of those insights for greenhouse gas controls,” said Parson. “But [climate change] is a bigger, tougher problem, and nobody’s yet put forward a kind of a concrete plan of how it would work.”

The regulation from the Environmental Protection Agency establishes a program to cut the use and production of chemicals known as hydrofluorocarbons by 85 percent over the next 15 years.
Curbing these super-pollutants is a rare climate issue with broad bipartisan support. When emitted, the chemicals can warm the planet at a rate hundreds to thousands of times higher than carbon dioxide. The new rule implements a law passed by Congress last year .

White House officials said the new rule tackles global warming while supporting jobs to manufacture new alternatives.
“It’s a win on climate and a win on jobs, and American competitiveness,” Gina McCarthy, the White House’s national climate coordinator, told reporters in an online briefing Wednesday evening. “It’s really — frankly, folks — a very big deal.”

President Biden’s team is trumpeting the new rule as a political win at a time when he is struggling to shepherd the rest of his climate agenda through Congress. Democrats are trying to pass a pair of bills aimed at expanding the adoption of solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles, but divisions between the party’s moderate and liberal wings have complicated their passage. It arrives weeks before a crucial United Nations climate summit where Biden will try to show the country can keep its commitments to reduce emissions.

Thursday’s announcement, by contrast, shows how much easier it is for federal agencies to tackle greenhouse gas emissions when empowered by legislation.
The EPA is putting a cap on hydrofluorocarbons through 2023, allocating allowances for companies to make or import them over the next two years. The agency will scale back their use further through 2036 with additional regulation.

Over the coming years, the newly launched program will bring big changes to the way numerous products that today rely on HFCs — including fire extinguishers, aerosol canisters and building insulation — are made.
By 2050, the program will cut nearly the same amount of greenhouse gas emissions as three years’ worth of pollution from the U.S. power sector, federal officials project.

Avipsa Mahapatra, climate campaign leader at the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), a nongovernmental advocacy group, praised regulators for tackling what she called “the most potent super-pollutants known to mankind at the moment.”
“This is a landmark EPA rulemaking,” she said.
Tracking Biden’s environmental actions
HFCs were once an environmental solution — not a problem. They replaced other chemicals that, when released into the atmosphere, eroded the Earth’s protective ozone layer. But their heat-trapping properties still exacerbated global warming. Five years ago, world leaders signed the Kigali Amendment, an update to the 1987 Montreal Protocol, to rein in these super-pollutants.

If fully met, the treaty is expected to prevent up to 0.5 degrees Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming by 2100. But President Donald Trump never submitted the treaty for Senate ratification, and his administration rolled backed Obama-era policies aimed at meeting the nation’s commitments under Kigali.
Biden promised to send the treaty to Capitol Hill just after taking office but has yet to do so, even as China and India ratified it this year. “We know he’s committed to taking that action,” McCarthy said, “but I don’t have a time window to discuss with you.”
Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, urged Biden to send the treaty as soon as possible. “There’s no reason to delay ratification,” he said in a statement.

The law underpinning the new restrictions, called the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, is a result of successful negotiations between the Democratic and Republican allies of environmentalists interested in curbing greenhouse gases and chemical manufacturers eager to sell alternative refrigerants.

A total of 70 companies — including 3M, Arkema, Chemours, Honeywell and Mexichem Fluor — reported making or importing the chemicals between 2011 and 2019, according to the EPA.
But many of those firms backed the law restricting the use of HFCs since they also market climate-friendly alternatives. Both Carper and Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.), who spearheaded the law, have chemical manufacturing in their states.

EPA chief Michael Regan, who signed the regulation Thursday, hailed the bipartisan legislation as “one of the most significant environmental laws in recent history.”
There’s an invisible climate threat seeping from grocery store freezers
Many companies must now wean themselves from using the versatile chemicals.
Seepage of the super-pollutants is pervasive at many U.S. grocery stores, where networks of chiller pipes leak the invisible gases. Several big chains, including Aldi and Amazon-owned Whole Foods, have taken steps to use alternative refrigerants in stores. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

Yet a recent undercover probe by the EIA underscores that the problem persists in some grocery stores. More than half of the supermarkets surveyed with leak detectors and infrared cameras in the Washington area were emitting the climate-warming refrigerants, investigators found in February.
Story continues below advertisement
Ridding supermarkets of the super-pollutants will involve swapping in more climate-friendly chemicals, or in some cases entirely replacing refrigeration systems.
Another industry pressed hard by new limitations are recreational boat manufacturers, which are scrambling to figure out a way of making lightweight plastic for hulls without using the newly restricted chemicals.
“We have to find an alternative, and they’re working hard to find one,” said John McKnight, a senior vice president at the National Marine Manufacturers Association.

The makers of heating and cooling equipment are eager for the new business the regulation will spark. Stephen Yurek, head of the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute, a trade group, said in a statement that the rule is “a critical step in the 15-year industry-supported process of phasing down HFCs.”

Some conservative critics are faulting the Biden administration for forcing a transition to more expensive products. “The proposed rule would hurt those least able to afford the increased cost of air conditioning while benefiting large corporate interests,” Clint Woods, a policy fellow at the libertarian advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, told the EPA in a public comment.
There is still a lot more for the federal government to do.
This week, the EPA also proposed a separate rule requiring manufacturers to control, capture and destroy a particularly potent manufacturing byproduct — called HFC-23 — that is more than 12,000 times more powerful than carbon dioxide over the course of a century. And in mid-October, the EPA will act on 13 petitions from green groups, companies and left-leaning states to further restrict the use of HFCs in a range of appliances, including dehumidifiers and commercial refrigeration equipment.

Danielle Wright, head of the North American Sustainable Refrigeration Council, a business group advocating for the use of ammonia and other alternative refrigerants at supermarkets, said the United States should pursue a much more aggressive timetable.
“We want to see it go much lower — much, much faster,” she said, adding that the European Union has mandated faster cuts across the board.
Yet European countries have been plagued by an influx of illicitly imported HFCs — something their U.S. counterparts are seeking to avoid. On Thursday, the White House launched a task force with EPA and Department of Homeland Security officials to detect and deter illegal trade of the chemicals that will soon become much scarcer.
The administration is also establishing a certification system using QR codes to track shipments in real time, making it “very tough to slip black-market products into the market,” according Cynthia Giles, who headed the EPA’s enforcement office under President Barack Obama.
David Doniger, an air pollution expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, praised the “positive, fast-moving start” by an often sluggish federal bureaucracy to establish the program, proposed in May. “When was the last time the EPA hit a statutory deadline?”

UPDATED: August 27, 2021 09:55 IST
The ozone layer acts as a blanket above the planet that safeguards us from the dangerous ultraviolet rays being emitted from the Sun.
While the world reels under the dangerous consequences of global warming, the Montreal Protocol has emerged as a ray of hope in tackling the menace of climate change. Protection of the ozone layer has prevented the planet from an additional 0.85 degrees Celsius of warming.
A new report indicates that by protecting the ozone layer, which blocks harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the Montreal Protocol that regulated ozone-depleting substances also protected plants and their ability to pull carbon from the atmosphere. The study published in the journal Nature states that the Montreal Protocol has co-benefits for climate change mitigation because ozone-depleting substances are potent greenhouse gases.
“We know the ozone layer is connected to the climate. We know greenhouse gases affect the ozone layer. But what we’ve never done before this is to connect the ozone layer to the terrestrial carbon cycle,” said lead author Paul Young, an atmospheric and climate scientist at Lancaster University.
Safeguarding the Ozone and its benefits
The adoption of the Montreal protocol has had co-benefits for plants and their capacity to store carbon through photosynthesis. Researchers found that there could have been 325690 billion tonnes less carbon held in plants and soils by the end of this century without the Montreal Protocol (as compared to climate projections with controls on ozone-depleting substances).
""This change could have resulted in an additional 115235 parts per million of atmospheric carbon dioxide, which might have led to an additional warming of global-mean surface temperature by 0.501.0 degrees ,"" the paper said. The team used a series of models to gain a more complete picture and simulate two hypothetical scenarios: the world projected and the world avoided.
The multilateral environmental agreement was designed to regulate the production and consumption of nearly 100 man-made chemicals. (Photo: Getty)
For the world-avoided scenario, researchers modelled simulations around CFC emissions increasing at the same rate as 3 per cent per year from the 1970s onward. They found that at that rate the ozone layer would have become much thinner by 2050, and by 2100, ""ozone holes forming in the tropics would be worse than what has been observed in the Antarctic ozone hole.""
They would have let more harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation reach the surface, inhibiting plants from storing carbon in their tissue and in the soil and CO2 levels are estimated to be 30 per cent higher than they are today leaving the planet an additional 0.85 degrees Celsius hotter. ""That’s on top of the warming Earth may experience due to prior and expected emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, as well as the 1.7 degree Celsius of direct warming due to increased CFC emissions in this scenario,"" researchers said.
What is the Montreal Protocol
The ozone layer acts as a blanket above the planet that safeguards us from the dangerous ultraviolet rays being emitted from the Sun, however, a hole discovered in this blanket has raised concerns for scientists worldwide. The hole, first spotted in 1985, was a result of emissions from ozone-depleting chemicals and greenhouse gases including chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), which had an application in a wide range of utilities and products.
The multilateral environmental agreement was designed to regulate the production and consumption of nearly 100 man-made chemicals referred to as ozone-depleting substances (ODS). The resolution was adopted on September 15, 1987, and is the only UN treaty ever that has been ratified by every country on Earth.
India's push for Montreal Protocol
India gave its nod for ratification of the Kigali Amendment earlier this month as it plans to phase out hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and substances that deplete the ozone layer as part of the Montreal Protocol. The approval came from the Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as India plans to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions.
A national strategy to phasedown hydrofluorocarbons will be developed after required consultation with all the industry stakeholders by 2023.

The broken $100-billion promise of climate finance — and how to fix it
At Glasgow’s COP26 summit, countries will argue for more money to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change.

Twelve years ago, at a United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen, rich nations made a significant pledge. They promised to channel US$100 billion a year to less wealthy nations by 2020, to help them adapt to climate change and mitigate further rises in temperature.
That promise was broken. Figures for 2020 are not yet in, and those who negotiated the pledge don’t agree on accounting methods, but a report last year for the UN 1 concluded that “the only realistic scenarios” showed the $100-billion target was out of reach. “We are not there yet,” conceded UN secretary-general António Guterres.
Frustrations at this failure are contributing to rising tensions ahead of next month’s crucial COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, UK. “By the time we get to Glasgow, if they haven’t given us another $100 billion [for 2021], then they are completely unable to meet their obligations,” says Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Dhaka.
Global climate action needs trusted finance data
Compared with the investment required to avoid dangerous levels of climate change, the $100-billion pledge is minuscule. Trillions of dollars will be needed each year to meet the 2015 Paris agreement goal of restricting global warming to “well below” 2 °C, if not 1.5 °C, above pre-industrial temperatures. And developing nations (as they are termed in the Copenhagen pledge) will need hundreds of billions of dollars annually to adapt to the warming that is already inevitable. “But the $100 billion is iconic in terms of the good faith of the countries that promised it,” Huq says.
A flurry of pledges just before the Glasgow meeting have led to hopes that, by 2022, rich nations will manage to transfer $100 billion annually. But negotiators are already looking further ahead: at COP26, discussions will begin on a new climate-finance pledge for the mid-2020s. Nature lays out how the $100-billion pledge failed, which countries are most to blame — and how climate finance might be transformed in the future.
How badly did rich countries fall short?
Negotiators never agreed on precisely how to measure countries’ pledges. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an intergovernmental body made up mostly of rich countries, bases its assessment on reports from the wealthy nations themselves. They contributed $80 billion in climate finance to developing countries in 2019, it announced in September 2 , up from $78 billion in 2018. Most of this money came from public grants or loans, transferred either from one country to another directly, or through funds from multilateral development banks (MDBs). A smaller amount is private finance that the public money is said to have mobilized, such as loan guarantees and loans given alongside public funds (see ‘Missed target’).

The figures are unlikely to have risen much in 2020: a June 2021 report from MDBs 3 suggests that the climate finance they provided to developing countries fell last year. “It isn’t a great sign,” says Joe Thwaites, who specializes in climate finance at the World Resources Institute (WRI) in Washington DC. International climate finance has probably stalled, he says, in part owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.
But some analysts say the OECD’s numbers are vastly inflated. In a 2020 report 4 , the international-aid charity Oxfam estimated public climate financing at only $19 billion–$22.5 billion in 2017–18, around one-third of the OECD’s estimate (see ‘Inflated figures?’). That is largely because Oxfam argues that, besides grants, only the benefit accrued from lending at below-market rates should be counted, not the full value of loans. It also says that some countries incorrectly count development aid as going towards climate projects. Japan, for instance, treats the full value of some aid projects as ‘climate relevant’ even when they don’t exclusively target climate action, says Tracy Carty, a senior policy adviser on climate change at Oxfam. As another example, some road construction projects are reported as climate aid, with most or all of their costs included in OECD estimates, says Romain Weikmans, a climate-finance specialist at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs in Helsinki.

Many low- and middle-income countries agree with Oxfam, and some go further: in 2015, India’s ministry of finance disputed the OECD’s estimate of $62 billion of climate finance in 2014, saying that the real figure was $1 billion. Diann Black-Layne, Antigua and Barbuda’s climate-change ambassador and formerly the lead climate negotiator for a group of low-lying coastal and island nations called the Alliance of Small Island States, says rich nations have intentionally inflated their climate aid.
Who is not paying enough?
Although rich nations collectively agreed to the $100-billion goal, they made no formal deal on what each should pay. Instead, countries announce pledges in the hope that others will follow. Multiple analyses of a notional fair share for these payments reach the same conclusion: the United States has fallen far short.
An October report from the WRI 5 reckoned that the US should contribute 40–47% of the $100 billion, depending on whether the calculation takes into account wealth, past emissions or population. But its average annual contribution from 2016 to 2018 was only around $7.6 billion, the WRI estimates. Australia, Canada and Greece also fell far short of what they should have contributed. Japan and France, on the other hand, have transferred more than their fair share — although almost all of their funding came in the form of repayable loans, not grants (see ‘Fair share’).
Source: Ref. 5
Where has the money gone?
Most of the climate finance has gone to projects to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. The Paris agreement aimed for a balance between these ‘mitigation’ projects and those that help people adapt to the effects of climate change. But just $20 billion went to adaptation projects in 2019, less than half of the funds for mitigation projects, the OECD found 2 (see ‘Adaptation lagging’). The UN estimates 6 that developing countries already need $70 billion per year to cover adaptation costs, and will need $140 billion–$300 billion in 2030.
Source: Ref. 2
Donors might favour mitigation projects because success is clear and measurable — it can be quantified by the avoided or captured carbon emissions — whereas it’s less easy to define successful adaptation, says climate-finance researcher Jessica Omukuti at the University of Oxford, UK, who works on equitable ways for the world to reach net zero carbon emissions. “A person or group is never fully adapted to climate change, because new climate risks and vulnerabilities emerge,” she says. Politicians in developed countries also perceive that they get more praise from other nations, and from domestic voters, for spending to reduce emissions, she adds, whereas adaptation aid is seen as only helping specific recipient countries.
Why fossil fuel subsidies are so hard to kill
Another reason for the imbalance between mitigation and adaptation is that money is increasingly provided as loans rather than grants. “Adaptation almost never is a loan-giving situation,” says Huq. “If you’re giving poor people money to help them deal with the impacts of climate change, that doesn’t generate money.” Private finance, in particular, almost always seems to go to mitigation projects that can generate returns on investment, such as solar farms and electric cars.
Most of the climate finance is also going to middle-income countries, not the poorest, most-vulnerable countries. “Many, many African countries are lamenting that they are not able to jump through the hoops [to access climate finance] because of the complexity and the technicality,” says Chukwumerije Okereke, an economist at Alex-Ekwueme Federal University Ndufu-Alike in Ikwo, Nigeria. “And they’re not receiving sufficient capacity-building exercises and training in this.”
Even the money that does go to the neediest countries might not be reaching its target. In July, the International Institute for Environment and Development in London reported that it had tried to track funding for adaptation projects in the UN’s 46 ‘least developed countries’, and could account for only $5.9 billion between 2014 and 2018, less than 20% of the amount developed countries said they had given. “How much actually goes to the most vulnerable people on the planet?” asks Huq.
What do developing countries want now?
The $100 billion pledge has long been seen as a minimum, to increase over time. But some recipient countries have said they are willing to accept a static target for now, if wealthy countries clearly set out how it will be met.
“The demand at the moment is since you failed to deliver the $100 billion in 2020, give us a plan for $500 billion over five years,” says Huq. In July, the ‘V20’, a group of finance ministers from 48 climate-vulnerable countries, called for that plan, including more grant-based finance, and at least 50% of funding to go to adaptation. Huq notes that countries are allocating their own budgets to climate change, too. Bangladesh’s government, for instance, says its climate-related spending totals about $3 billion: that’s some 7% of the government’s overall budget, or 0.73% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). And poor families in rural Bangladesh spend $2 billion a year themselves on preventing climate-related disasters or repairing the damage they cause, notes an Oxfam analysis (see go.nature.com/2yuycvn ).

New pledges have been pouring in: Canada, Japan and Germany announced theirs at a meeting of the G7 group of wealthy nations in June, at which countries also reaffirmed their commitment to contribute $100 billion annually through to 2025. In September, the European Union pledged an extra $5 billion by 2027, and US President Joe Biden promised that the United States would provide $11.4 billion in annual financing by 2024, which would make it the largest single climate-finance contributor. But much of that funding requires US Congressional approval, and many other countries will be contributing much more as a proportion of their economy. “The EU and its member states are already providing roughly double the amount the US has pledged, even with a combined economy just three-quarters the size of America’s,” says Thwaites.
Young people will be key to climate justice at COP26
The question remains of whether rich nations can convince less wealthy ones that they are serious about meeting their pledges. Some people argue that promises should exclude private finance, to avoid confusion. Still, the extra pledges should enable wealthy nations to reach the $100 billion target for 2022, according to climate economist Nicholas Stern at the London School of Economics.
Some governments are addressing the call for more adaptation funding. In August, Denmark said it would allocate 60% of its climate finance to adaptation, and other countries, including the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, have committed to ramping up adaptation finance.
At COP26, formal negotiations will also begin on a post-2025 goal. A specific climate-finance target is unlikely to be set this year, although in July, South African environment minister Barbara Creecy suggested a figure of $750 billion a year by 2030. Many countries also want extra finance for ‘loss and damage’, to help people experiencing irreversible climate-related losses that cannot be adapted to.
How much climate finance is enough?
Increasingly, the concept of climate finance is becoming redundant, Huq argues. “Every dollar spent is climate money spent,” he says. “You either spend it wisely or you spend it unwisely.”
However, the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI), a non-profit research group based in San Francisco, California, estimates 7 that flows of climate-related finance in and between countries amounted to $632 billion per year in 2019–20, or about 0.7% of the world’s GDP. Around half of this was private funding, much of it for renewable-energy generation (see ‘The climate-finance universe’).
Source: Ref. 7
That is far below the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s estimate that $1.6 trillion–$3.8 trillion is required annually to avoid warming exceeding 1.5 °C. Frustratingly, fossil fuels are still being subsidized , receiving some $554 billion per year between 2017 and 2019, by one estimate. And in 2020, annual global military spending reached $2 trillion.
The CPI warns that the pandemic and its economic effects have put an emphasis on spending in areas such as public health (developed nations spent trillions last year to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic), making the mid-to-long-term prospects of climate finance uncertain. The real challenge now is how to ensure that the wider universe of private finance is spent on projects that address the problems of climate change, says Sarah Colenbrander, director of the climate and sustainability programme at the Overseas Development Institute, a think tank based in London. “If we don’t do that, we are going to fail on climate even more catastrophically than we’ve already done,” she says.

Our maps, developed with experts, show where extreme heat is causing the most deaths in the U.S.
This approach culminated in late 2015 with the Paris Climate Agreement, gaveled into existence in a huge plywood conference hall outside Paris, where cheers rang out and Champagne flowed. Climate change was now seen as a problem every country had a responsibility to tackle.
Even so, the national pledges made at Paris were wholly inadequate. If met, they would still have allowed global warming to rise to dangerous levels. Recognizing this, the delegates in Paris adopted a “ratchet” mechanism, requiring countries to show up every five years and make new, bolder pledges. That was supposed to happen in 2020, but was delayed a year by the pandemic. So it is in Glasgow this year that the first new pledges come due.
Britain, which is hosting the conference, is cajoling the world’s countries to go big. Many of them say that they will cut their emissions close to zero by 2050 or 2060, and the bold ones are setting 2030 targets. That is important, because tough 2030 targets make procrastination harder; they demand action from the politicians who are now in office.
Emissions in the United States have already fallen about 20 percent from their peak in 2005. Much of that effort was carried out by state and local governments and by industry, the real workhorses on this issue in America. President Biden has pledged to cut national emissions in half by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, and largely eliminate them by 2050. But he has had trouble muscling his plans through Congress and arrived in Glasgow nearly empty-handed.
Given the long and troubled track record of these international negotiations, have they had any real value? The best way to view the history is to say that nearly a quarter-century of failure has been followed by six years of moderate success.
The world’s international institutions and global treaties are inherently weak, and the climate agreement is among our weakest treaties. And yet it offers, in these regular meetings, a stage on which the climate drama can play out.
Leaders go to these conferences and make pledges because they are embarrassed not to. Yes, the pledges are still too weak, countries are not on track to meet even their weak pledges, and the world is, collectively, a long way from where it needs to be.
Emissions are not the only issue. Rich countries promised $100 billion a year in aid for poor countries to cope with the climate emergency, and they have failed to deliver the full sum. The United States is among the biggest deadbeats. Expect a lot of fireworks on this issue. It is one of several that could cause the conference to dissolve in recrimination and failure.
As delegates haggle, it is in the work on the ground where real hope is to be found. If emissions can fall in dozens of countries, as they have, they can eventually fall in all countries. If Norway can get to a point where 60 percent of new cars sold are electric, so can every nation. If California can order that every new house built have solar panels on the roof, so can every American state.
So let the jawboning begin. Let the world leaders make their commitments, and then return home to tackle the real work.

Messages from the climate talks this week have focused on ambition and equity more than commas and semicolons.
That’s because most aspects of the Paris Agreement’s rulebook were settled three years ago in Katowice, Poland, bringing an important chapter in the negotiations to an end.
Or almost.
There are a few unfinished pieces related to the rulebook, and those fall to the delegates gathered at the Scottish Event Campus this week and next for the meeting known as COP 26.
The most important one has to do with climate projects that cross national boundaries, otherwise known as Article 6 of the Paris deal. Negotiators still have to put the finishing touches on how countries trade carbon offsets — either informally or as part of a new centralized market mechanism — and how they use non-market-based approaches to cut emissions in other countries.
These are wonky issues rife with acronyms. But experts say they’re inseparable from the marquee goals of the Glasgow conference — namely, how the world can limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and ensure that vulnerable countries have the resources they need to face changes that are already baked into the global climate system.
“You kind of can’t get to net zero, and anything close to the 2-degree or 1.5-degree level, unless you have cooperation, and honest cooperation, so there is an ability to tap into the economic efficiencies,” said Dirk Forrister, CEO of the International Emissions Trading Association.
This is true in the near term, he said, and as the century progresses.
The Paris deal calls on countries to stop adding emissions to the atmosphere in the second half of this century, and a growing number have pledged to go net zero by 2050 or in the decades following.
But carbon removal will play a role in achieving that objective, Forrister noted, “and most countries don’t have enough removal capacity on their own to be able to get there.”
While large, highly forested countries might have sufficient natural carbon sinks to meet those goals, most developing countries will need carbon capture and storage capacity — and that will require foreign investment.
Discussions over Article 6 have continued this week, with negotiators outlining options before the weekend, when ministers arrive to weigh in on the stickiest issues. It includes international mitigation efforts that are not market-based. It also allows pairs or small groups of countries to trade offsets on their own — which some have already started piloting.
But some of the most persistent issues that have dogged negotiations over the last five years center on the creation of a formal market-based mechanism to serve the Paris Agreement. It would allow countries to make progress toward their emissions-reduction commitments by investing in projects elsewhere in the world. It’s of particular concern to the Global South, where opportunities for climate abatement are plentiful but capital is not.
This is not the first time a climate deal has featured a trading mechanism. The Clean Development Mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol didn’t have a strong track record on environmental integrity or human rights — a fact most countries are anxious to avoid in the new Paris market.
There were instances of countries intentionally creating high-emitting hot spots in order to be paid to shut them down. There were questions about whether carbon reductions would have occurred without CDM investment and stories of local populations having their land rights stripped to generate credits for trade.
The United Nations is attempting to absorb those lessons. But there are countries that did well under the CDM and still have credits that qualified under that system. Now they want to be able to sell them under the new system.
And the U.N. climate body operates on consensus — allowing any country to hold up negotiations indefinitely if it doesn’t get its way.
'Old credits lying around'
One of the questions that must be settled to finalize Article 6 is whether CDM credits can be counted toward Paris. And if so, which ones, how many and for how long.
“There are a lot of these old credits lying around,” said Alex Hanafi, director of multilateral climate strategy with the Environmental Defense Fund. “These are old credits based on old rules. We’re now in the new Paris Agreement with new rules.”
Kelley Kizzier, EDF’s vice president of global climate, said progress had been made since the climate conference in Madrid two years ago, which failed to complete work on Article 6 despite technical progress.
The CDM executive board and a separate U.N.-affiliated body that governs civil aviation have both made determinations about the eligibility of Kyoto Protocol credits. Those decisions could influence the number of credits that are allowed to flow into the Paris market for sale to countries looking to offset their domestic emissions.
The International Civil Aviation Organization, or ICAO, limited CDM credits eligible under its own emissions trading system to those generated in 2016 or later. Negotiators in Glasgow are likely to take that limitation into account, Kizzier said.
“It becomes a chicken-and-egg thing,” she said. “If the [U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change] made calls about which credits would be eligible, that would then impact [ICAO’s program] and vice versa.”
Besides the carry-over issue, negotiators must also decide how to prevent emissions reductions from being counted twice, something that could undermine the integrity of the agreement.
A fundamental difference between the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and the 2015 Paris Agreement is that the latter relies on mitigation commitments from rich and poor countries alike.
“Under the Kyoto Protocol there was a bifurcation of the developed countries having quantified targets and the developing countries not having any, but they could be host to projects,” said Rick Saines, a partner at the climate change advisory firm Pollination.
“In this context, every country has now submitted a nationally determined contribution,” he said.
When a country sells a credit for a project in a sector that is covered under its nationally determined contribution, or NDC, can it continue to count those tons of avoided CO2 toward its own contribution? Or should that only be counted toward the purchasing country’s bottom line?
Brazil has insisted that both countries should get credit for reductions in traded credits, at least for a time. It argues that barring countries from counting reductions made in certain sectors encourages them to offer less comprehensive and ambitious NDCs.
“I think that Brazil’s view is that some of the ways that others think about double counting is too simplistic,” said Kizzier. “And other people's view is ‘but double counting is simple. It shouldn’t happen.’”
Another question is how to satisfy the Paris Agreement requirement that some revenue from trading be set aside to help vulnerable countries adapt to climate change. Also to be determined: how to meet a Paris directive that the trading mechanism delivers more overall ambition than would have existed otherwise.
A U.N. report released before COP 26 that highlighted the gap between current commitments and what science says is needed to achieve the Paris temperature goals notes that many countries have included market mechanisms in their NDCs and are waiting for the Article 6 negotiations to conclude.
“Carbon markets can deliver real emissions abatement and drive ambition, but only when rules are clearly defined, designed to ensure that transactions reflect actual reductions in emissions, and supported by arrangements to track progress and provide transparency,” the U.N. Environment Programme states in its report.

Why are countries aiming to keep global temperature rise below 1.5°C?
Scientists have warned for years of catastrophic environmental consequences if global temperature continues to rise at the current pace. The Earth’s average temperature has already increased approximately 1.1°C above preindustrial levels, according to a 2021 assessment [PDF] by the IPCC. The report, drafted by more than two hundred scientists from over sixty countries, predicts that the world will reach or exceed 1.5°C of warming within the next two decades even if nations drastically cut emissions immediately.
A earlier, more comprehensive IPCC report summarized the severe effects expected to occur when the global temperature warms by 1.5°C:
Heat waves. Many regions will suffer more hot days, with about 14 percent of people worldwide being exposed to periods of severe heat at least once every five years. 
Droughts and floods. Regions will be more susceptible to droughts and floods, making farming more difficult, lowering crop yields, and causing food shortages. 
Rising seas. Tens of millions of people live in coastal regions that will be submerged in the coming decades. Small island nations are particularly vulnerable.
“We’re headed toward disaster if we can’t get our warming in check.”

Ocean changes. Up to 90 percent of coral reefs will be wiped out , and oceans will become more acidic. The world’s fisheries will become far less productive.
Arctic ice thaws. At least once a century, the Arctic will experience a summer with no sea ice , which has not happened in at least two thousand years. Forty percent of the Arctic’s permafrost will thaw by the end of the century. 
Species loss. More insects, plants, and vertebrates will be at risk of extinction. 
The consequences will be far worse if the 2°C threshold is reached, scientists say. “We’re headed toward disaster if we can’t get our warming in check and we need to do this very quickly,” says Alice C. Hill, CFR senior fellow for energy and the environment.
Which countries are responsible for climate change?
The answer depends on who you ask and how you measure emissions. Ever since the first climate talks in the 1990s, officials have debated which countries—developed or developing—are more to blame for climate change and should therefore curb their emissions.
Developing countries argue that developed countries have emitted more greenhouse gases over time. They say these developed countries should now carry more of the burden because they were able to grow their economies without restraint. Indeed, the United States has emitted the most of all time, followed by the European Union (EU). 
However, China and India are now among the world’s top annual emitters, along with the United States. Developed countries have argued that those countries must do more now to address climate change.
In the context of this debate, major climate agreements have evolved in how they pursue emissions reductions. The Kyoto Protocol required only developed countries to reduce emissions, while the Paris Agreement recognized that climate change is a shared problem and called on all countries to set emissions targets.
Are the commitments made under the Paris Agreement enough?
Most experts say no. Countries’ pledges are not ambitious enough and will not be enacted quickly enough to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C. Current policies could result in a 2.7°C (4.9°F) rise by 2100, according to the Climate Action Tracker compiled by Germany-based nonprofits Climate Analytics and the NewClimate Institute.
“The Paris Agreement is not enough. Even at the time of negotiation, it was recognized as not being enough,” says CFR’s Hill. “It was only a first step, and the expectation was that as time went on, countries would return with greater ambition to cut their emissions.”
Dozens of countries actually submitted bolder pledges ahead of the COP26 summit in November 2021, the deadline for countries to revisit their NDCs. For example, President Biden announced in April 2021 that the United States will aim to cut emissions by 50 to 52 percent below its 2005 level by 2030, doubling President Barack Obama’s commitment. In addition, the final agreement from COP26, the Glasgow Climate Pact , urged countries to submit new, more ambitious NDCs by the end of 2022, instead of waiting five years.
But the world’s average temperature will still rise 2.1°C (3.8°F) by 2100 even if countries fully implement their pledges for 2030 and beyond. If the more than one hundred countries that have set or are considering net-zero targets follow through, warming could be limited to 1.8˚C (3.2°F), according to the Climate Action Tracker.
What are the alternatives to the Paris Agreement?
Many experts foresee the most meaningful climate action happening outside of the Paris Agreement. Some call for the creation of a climate club —an idea championed by Yale University economist William Nordhaus—that would penalize countries that do not meet their obligations or do not join. Others propose new treaties [PDF] that apply to specific emissions or sectors to complement the Paris Agreement. 
“Progress is going to happen not globally with all countries joined together, but in smaller groups and by sector,” says Victor. There were several examples of this in the lead up to and during COP26: Group of Twenty (G20) countries pledged to stop financing new coal-fired power plants abroad. Dozens of countries signed a U.S.- and EU-led commitment to collectively reduce emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, by 30 percent by 2030. And more than 130 countries pledged to halt and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030.
Many cities, companies, and organizations are also making plans to lower emissions, heeding the UNFCCC’s call to become climate neutral by the second half of the century. In the United States, more than six hundred local governments [PDF] have detailed climate action plans that include emissions-reduction targets. Meanwhile, investors are putting more money into climate-friendly funds. During COP26, more than 450 banks, insurers, pension funds, and other firms that collectively manage $130 trillion committed to use their funds to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Large companies including Amazon and Starbucks have also made carbon-neutrality commitments. Some have gone further to say they will be carbon negative, removing more carbon from the atmosphere than they release. However, critics have accused some of these companies of greenwashing : marketing themselves as eco-conscious while continuing harmful practices.
Although these moves are important for raising awareness and reducing some emissions, “it’s all pretty small relative to governments around the world setting a forceful climate policy,” Michael Greenstone, an economics professor at the University of Chicago, tells CFR’s Why It Matters podcast .

The August 2021 report of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that pollution caused by humans has led to an increase in extreme events such as heat waves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from global economic activity are at the heart of climate change, with atmospheric CO2 already 50% above its pre-industrialization levels.
Unsurprisingly, corporations face growing pressure—from investors, advocacy groups, politicians, and even business leaders themselves—to reduce GHG emissions from their operations and their supply and distribution chains. The nearly 200 CEOs of the Business Roundtable, representing some of America’s largest and best-known companies, have responded by issuing a collective statement on their commitment to “the purpose of a corporation,” which includes better environmental performance. This commitment is seemingly backed up by action: About 90% of companies in the S&P 500 now issue some form of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) report, almost always including an estimate of the company’s GHG emissions.
But ESG in its current form is more a buzzword than a solution. Each of its three domains presents different measurement opportunities and challenges, a fact not adequately addressed by existing disclosure standards. As a consequence, few ESG reports engage meaningfully with the moral trade-offs within the three domains and with the company’s profits. Companies also selectively present metrics that portray themselves in a favorable light, resulting in the widespread perception that ESG reporting is awash in greenwash. Not surprisingly, auditors of these reports often resort to double negatives—“We found no evidence of misreporting in the company’s ESG report”—and the reports themselves have had little impact on either corporate actions or external stakeholders.
We propose that companies tackle ESG reporting in a more targeted and auditable way. They should first develop specific and objective metrics for the most important and immediate ESG problems, rather than produce catchall reports that are often made up of inaccurate, unverifiable, and contradictory data. GHG emissions are the ideal starting point for such an approach. They represent the most immediate danger to the planet, and they are among the easiest of ESG items to reliably measure and interpret.
Among the companies that already provide GHG estimates in their reporting, most—including 92% of the Fortune 500 in 2016—rely on an approach called the GHG Protocol. Introduced in 2001 and updated several times since, this protocol established a common language for GHG measurement that enabled companies to start their environmental reporting journey. It is the default methodology underlying most ESG disclosure standards. But as we show in the following pages, the protocol has serious conceptual errors: The same emissions are reported multiple times by different companies, while some entities entirely ignore emissions from their supply and distribution chains. Indeed, the poor accountability of ESG reports stems partly from the flaws in the GHG Protocol.
The good news is that the defects in the protocol can be fixed. The solution we present here integrates recent advances in measuring emissions by environmental engineers, the introduction of blockchain technologies to accounting and auditing, and two centuries’ worth of progress in financial and cost accounting practices. If implemented, our solution will enable GHG reports to approach the relevance and reliability expected of today’s corporate financial reports. What’s more, much of what is learned through this process can help companies better measure other environmentally damaging outputs—and many socially damaging ones as well.
What’s Wrong with the GHG Protocol
The protocol identifies three types of GHG emissions and gives explicit guidance for measuring and reporting them.
Scope 1:
Direct emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by a company, such as its production and transportation equipment.
Scope 2:
Emissions at facilities that generate electricity bought and consumed by the company.
Scope 3:
Emissions from upstream operations in a company’s supply chain and from downstream activities by the company’s customers and end-use consumers.
Scope 1 emissions are the easiest to measure and the most relevant for companies that directly produce large quantities of GHG: fossil-fuel energy companies; mining, metallurgical, and chemical companies; and large-scale agribusinesses. Most other companies, including those in the services sector, produce only small amounts of Scope 1 emissions.
Scopes 2 and 3 essentially cover all GHG emissions indirectly linked to a company’s operations. The GHG Protocol carved Scope 2 emissions out of Scope 3 because they are easily measured and allocated to specific companies. Several hundred companies currently report their Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Scope 3 emissions are the fatal flaw in GHG reporting. The protocol’s creators included them to encourage companies to exert influence over emissions that they don’t control directly. For example, they could buy from or sell to companies with lower Scope 1 emissions, and collaborate with their suppliers and customers to reduce GHG emissions along their value chains. But the difficulty of tracking emissions from multiple suppliers and customers across multitier value chains makes it virtually impossible for a company to reliably estimate its Scope 3 numbers.
The E-liability accounting system eliminates the duplicative counting of emissions. It also reduces incentives for gaming and manipulation.
Consider the challenges faced by a manufacturer of car doors. Protocol for Scope 3 reporting requires the company to track all GHG emissions from the processes of its upstream suppliers, including the extraction of metallurgical coal and iron ore, the transport of those minerals to a steel producer, the production of sheet steel from the coal, iron ore, and other inputs, and the transport of that steel to its own production facility. The car-door company must also estimate the GHG impact of downstream activities, including transport of the car door to its customer (the automotive-assembly factory), manufacture of the finished car, transport of the car to a showroom, and operation of the vehicle, for perhaps 15 years, by the end-use consumer.
Estimating all those upstream and downstream emissions—especially for companies with long, complex, and multi-jurisdictional value chains—introduces high measurement error, opening the door to bias and manipulation. Moreover, the Scope 3 protocol requires each company in a value chain to estimate and report GHG emissions from the same activity, which is not only inefficient but generates the duplication mentioned above—an obvious defect in any accounting system.
Not surprisingly, many ESG-reporting companies ignore Scope 3 measurements entirely. But that limits any meaningful contribution to mitigating total emissions across their supply and distribution chains. It also skews responsibility to those suppliers with high-emitting extraction, production, and distribution processes while absolving their customers and consumers of accountability for using heavily polluting components.
We can fix this problem by examining how cost and financial accountants estimate a company’s value added—a fundamental corporate measurement task.
When our car-door manufacturer calculates its value added, it does not estimate all the prices paid by all the organizations across all the stages of its value chain. Rather, each organization records only what it pays for goods and services from its immediate suppliers and what it receives when it sells products to immediate customers.
Let’s assume, for simplicity’s sake, that all transfers of materials in the manufacturer’s value chain are made at cost from stage to stage (eliminating the profit margin in the sale and transfer). In this case, the manufacturer’s acquisition costs from its immediate suppliers include the total cost of extracting the original materials (incurred by the mining company) plus all the labor, machining, and indirect costs for the materials as they were handled and processed by the sequence of suppliers until the materials reached the car-door manufacturer. The manufacturer adds its own labor, machining, and indirect costs to the acquisition costs to calculate the total manufacturing cost of the door when sold and transferred to the automotive-assembly company. This process continues down the value chain until the car’s eventual purchase by a consumer.
The same idea can be applied to GHG emissions.
Tracking Emissions Across an Entire Value Chain
To illustrate, start with the car-door manufacturer’s furthest-removed supplier, a mining company in (let’s say) Perth, in western Australia. That company extracts the metallurgical coal and iron ore that eventually find their way into the door. It measures its total Scope 1 emissions during a reporting period using a combination of chemistry and engineering, and then, combining that science with cost accounting, assigns its total emissions to the tons of coal, iron ore, and all other minerals extracted during the period. The latter process is similar to the way it estimates the unit production costs of its outputs in a standard activity-based costing system (more on this below). The calculation produces an estimate of GHG emissions per ton of each type of material produced. Whereas financial accounting would record the monetary cost of producing a ton of material as inventory—an asset on its balance sheet—we label the GHG units emitted per ton of extracted material an E-liability, reflecting their environmental cost to society.
When the mining company transfers the coal and iron ore to a shipping company, the shipping company assumes the E-liability from the mining company on its E-accounting books (much the way it assumes production inputs as inventory on its financial-accounting books). If the mining company transfers all the materials it mines in the reporting period to downstream entities like the shipping company, its E-liability account at the end of the period will match what it was at the beginning.
As its ocean barge travels from Perth to, say, Port Talbot, Wales, the shipping company adds to its E-liability account the quantity of GHG produced to power the barge’s engines. Using basic cost-accounting methods, it assigns the barge’s total E-liability to the materials carried on board. At Port Talbot, if the company transfers 38% of the barge’s iron ore and 6% of its coal to a steel producer, it will, on its E-accounting ledger, also transfer the same percentages of their E-liabilities to the steel company, which now “owns” those liabilities.
The steel company produces its own Scope 1 emissions by operating furnaces and rolling mills to produce sheet steel. Through the same accounting process, it allocates its bought and incurred E-liability to each ton of sheet steel produced. When the steel is transferred to a railroad company for transport, each ton carries its share of accumulated E-liability—from the mining company, all transportation so far, and the GHG emissions from the steel-production process.
When, several days later, the steel is processed through the receiving dock of the car-door manufacturing company in, say, Solihull, England, the steel’s E-liability—which now includes its per-ton share of the emissions from the railroad company’s transport from Port Talbot to Solihull—is transferred to the car-door company. This process continues until the consumer who buys the finished car receives a report card on the quantity of GHG emissions produced throughout its manufacture and transportation.
Of ESG’s three components, environmental is the most amenable to rigorous corporate reporting.
Some companies may choose to directly eliminate GHG from the atmosphere—for instance, by engaging in carbon capture or reforestation. A company that does so can subtract that amount from its E-liability account, subject to auditing, thus reducing its liability transfers along the distribution chain to, eventually, the end-use consumer.
Measuring and Allocating Emissions
This new accounting system requires two basic steps: (1) Calculate the net E-liabilities the company creates and eliminates each period, adding them to the E-liabilities it acquires and has accumulated, and (2) allocate some or all of the total E-liabilities to the units of output produced by the company during the reporting period. For the first step, environmental engineers can estimate the quantity of GHG emissions from a company’s primary-source activities, such as burning hydrocarbons for electricity, heat, and transport; producing metals, cement, glass, and chemicals; agriculture involving livestock emissions and deforestation or reforestation; and waste management.
The second step is identical to activity-based costing (ABC) for assigning overhead and other costs to the multiple products and services produced in a given period. Let’s assume that the shipping company transfers only two products from Perth to Port Talbot—coal and iron ore. The company acquires the E-liabilities associated with those products from the mine on a per-ton basis. Since the products are also transferred to the steel mill on a per-ton basis, the cost accounting is straightforward—the E-liability transfer is analogous to a direct cost in an ABC system.
But as noted, transportation from Perth to Port Talbot generates additional GHG, which must be allocated to the cargo. Iron ore is denser than metallurgical coal, so the E-liabilities associated with transporting the two differ. An ABC-inspired allocation system can apply cost drivers associated with weight, volume, and distance to calculate the precise apportionments.
As with physical inventory, E-liabilities acquired or produced but not transferred to customers in a given period are held for future transfer. This feature of E-liability accounting allows companies to hold and depreciate GHG emissions from fixed assets such as plant and equipment. Consider a steel mill that installs a blast furnace, thus incurring GHG liabilities—such as for emissions from the production and transport of bricks used to line the furnace. These “capitalized” GHG liabilities can be depreciated over each period of the furnace’s useful life. In a calculation that replicates cost accounting’s allocation of the furnace’s acquisition and installation costs to outputs produced during its operation, the E-liability system assigns a proportion of the furnace’s E-liability to each period’s production.
What Companies Report
With the two accounting steps addressed, companies can report on the stocks and flows of their E-liabilities just as they report on their opening inventory, annual purchases of raw materials, finished goods produced, cost of goods sold, and closing inventory. The equivalent items would be net E-liabilities at the beginning of a period, E-liabilities acquired, net E-liabilities produced during the period, E-liabilities disposed of (sold), and net E-liabilities at the end of the period.
Some environmental activists may fear that transferring a company’s entire Scope 1 emissions to downstream customers will enable the company to escape scrutiny for GHG-intensive operations. But just as a good financial analyst looks beneath a company’s net income to analyze cost of goods sold and changes in inventory levels, an environmental analyst could interpret the details of a company’s purchase, production, and disposal of E-liabilities.
The Benefits of E-Liability Accounting
The E-liability accounting system offers several advantages. Most important, it eliminates the duplicative counting of emissions that is embedded in current Scope 3 measurements. It also reduces incentives for gaming and manipulation. A company cannot reduce its reported Scope 1 emissions simply by outsourcing production and then, as is currently possible, ignoring its Scope 3 emissions on the grounds of high measurement error and lack of access to distant suppliers and customers. In the E-liability system, any GHG emissions produced by an outsourced supplier will be transferred to the company upon purchase. What’s more, a company can’t benefit from understating the E-liability transferred to its customers, because its own end-of-period net E-liability would steadily escalate, suggesting that the company’s products are more heavily polluting than customers will accept. Conversely, a company attempting to overstate E-liability transfers to downstream customers would meet with resistance from buyers that preferred to engage with less-polluting suppliers.
The system also allows for its own materiality standard. Currently, several major ESG reporting standards require companies to disclose whenever environmental considerations pose a material financial risk to a company. That allows many GHG-intensive processes to go unreported when they have no material impact on a company’s financial statements. The E-liability system can apply a materiality threshold specific for GHG, regardless of the financial impact.
Finally, a company’s end-of-period E-liability balance can be audited in much the same way that its financial asset and liability accounts are. The external auditors (preferably a team including environmental engineers and cost accountants) can verify the company’s internal GHG measurement and allocation models and its purchases and transfers, particularly of GHG-intensive products and services, and reconcile E-liability balances at the beginning and the end of the period. Auditors can cross-check a client’s E-liability transactions with corresponding activity in the financial accounts: A red flag would be raised if E-liabilities booked seemed unusually small, relative to industry peers, for the scale of the client’s inventory movements in a period.
Blockchain technology, starting with the first stage of production, can be used to accumulate and transfer E-liabilities from stage to stage, reducing accounting and auditing costs across the entire system. Blockchains are especially useful in recording Scope 1 emissions at each stage so that subsequent E-liability transfers must always reconcile with the total Scope 1 number in a value chain. The E-liability system is unlikely to introduce burdensome record-keeping, because it can run on a company’s existing financial-reporting and cost-accounting infrastructure, simply using a different unit of measurement: the quantity of GHG emissions rather than the amount of cash and cash equivalents.
Deploying E-Liability Across the Economy
The pressure to do sustainability reporting has been put primarily on publicly traded companies, by their investors and analysts. But restricting the reporting of GHG emissions to such companies would motivate some to go private (and the private ones to remain so) to avoid environmental measurement and disclosure. Thus all companies should be encouraged to report on their E-liabilities, including large private ones such as Bechtel, Bosch, Cargill, Koch, and Mars and those financed through joint ventures, limited partnerships, venture capital, or private equity. Only very small companies with negligible quantities of acquired and produced GHG should be exempt from E-liability reporting.

But corporations are not the only traders in GHG emissions. State-owned enterprises and government agencies, including defense, transportation, energy, and health care, produce and consume many tons of emissions, and they too should be expected to adopt E-liability reporting.
Reliable GHG reporting would also help banks and investment funds respond to demands that they report the emissions of their portfolio companies. Standard-setters such as the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures have created formulas for determining how to weight various investment assets on the basis of features such as the nature of the security (debt versus equity, for example) and the degree of control exercised by the investment vehicle over that security. But although those formulas can be useful, the current measurement of the underlying pollutants—the sum of a company’s Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions—remains fundamentally flawed, for the reasons we have described. The E-liability system provides a more reliable way of calculating the total pollution from assets under management as a weighted total of the portfolio companies’ end-of-period E-liabilities. Banks and investment funds using the system would have a far better foundation for influencing and reporting on their portfolio companies’ environmental impact.
The E-liability approach to GHG accounting would obviate the simplistic labeling of certain sectors, such as fossil fuels and mining, as “sin” industries from which ethical investors should divest. That practice is unlikely to contribute to reducing global emissions, because those industries would not exist at their scale were their outputs not used by “clean” (low Scope 1) companies for their own production and consumption. Our proposed approach recognizes the integrated nature of pollution activities across the economy and encourages all businesses, regardless of sector, to take GHG emissions into account in their product design, purchasing, and selling decisions.
While waiting for new reporting regulation on E-liabilities, large companies—especially signatories to the Business Roundtable’s corporate-purpose statement—can put their rhetoric into practice by voluntarily adopting this system and requiring their large suppliers and customers to do the same. That could create competitive advantage by signaling to environmentally sensitive consumers and investors that the company is making auditable progress in reducing total-value-chain GHG emissions. The power of demand- and supply-side markets and competition, informed by E-liability reporting, could encourage corporations to engage in verifiable climate-change action rather than simply issue greenwashed ESG statements.
If governments judged that competitive forces unleashed by robust environmental disclosures were insufficient to achieve targeted reductions in global GHG emissions, the E-liability system would provide them with the tracks on which a variety of carbon-based tax trains could run. They could assess a VAT-like tax on the difference between a company’s E-liability transfers and its acquisitions. Companies attempting to avoid the tax by outsourcing the production of heavily polluting products would most likely encounter higher purchase prices to compensate suppliers for the higher taxes being levied on them. Governments could also assess a capital-gains-like tax on large buildups in a company’s end-of-period E-liability balance caused by customers’ unwillingness to buy the products of heavily polluting production processes. A third option would be to tax the total E-liability of consumers’ purchased products and services to raise their environmental sensitivity even further. (Per capita carbon-tax dividends would mitigate the burden on low-income consumers.)
Michael Schauer
Carbon taxes are not without problems, however. A tax not imposed and enforced globally could engender a flight of corporate activity to nontaxing countries. Offsetting noncompliance with pollution tariffs would be difficult to implement given current international trade laws. And a worldwide carbon tax seems a distant goal in light of geopolitical considerations and issues with enforceability—such as avoidance by state-owned enterprises, especially in countries with less-than-transparent legal systems that already subvert global agreements with hidden subsidies for domestic employers. Driving market-based corporate action on climate change through E-liability reporting may be the fastest way to start systemically reducing GHG emissions.
Going Beyond E
Insights from the widespread deployment of E-liability accounting could inform standards for broader ESG reporting. Of course, no single reporting solution will be relevant for all components of ESG: As noted, ESG is not a single concept. From a reporting perspective, the only thing that E, S, and G have in common is that none is a financial metric. And developing a reporting, evaluation, and investment system for metrics united only by what they are not is hardly a recipe for success.
The lack of a common framework for the three elements leads to contradictions even within a single ESG report. Consider a company under pressure from stakeholders to reduce GHG emitted from its fleet of fossil-fueled vehicles. The company may switch to electric vehicles, resulting in a lower carbon footprint. But what if the battery suppliers for the electric vehicles use conflict raw materials—tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (3TG)—mined by indentured prisoners? Or consider a company that has been criticized and excluded from investment portfolios because its ESG report indicates a high rate of workplace accidents. The company may solve its problem by introducing automation and outsourcing, with the result that its report the following year shows many fewer accidents. But what about the unmeasured and unreported loss of employment among former workers and the economic impact on local communities and suppliers?
Some advocates for ESG reporting want to go beyond disclosure to estimate the monetary value of components for inclusion in the company’s income statement. Such a statement, they argue, would represent a more comprehensive measure of the true profits of a company. But it is far harder to calculate the value of many ESG components—the impact of a company’s labor practices, workforce diversity, and governance, for example—than it is to estimate the accruals based on future cash flows that underlie basic financial reporting.
Consider the decades-long efforts of some accountants just to put human resources on a company’s balance sheet, in an attempt to quantify a CEO’s statement that “employees are our most valuable asset.” Those efforts failed because the measures of employee value were either irrelevant (such as how much was spent historically on hiring and training employees) or they were subjective and unverifiable. Moreover, it would be even harder, if not impossible, to find a formula to aggregate the value of ESG’s diverse components: Doing so would require some universally accepted ethical code for navigating the intra-ESG trade-offs alluded to above. By treating diverse nonfinancial performance as a single concept, ESG advocates have arguably inhibited fundamental and rigorous thinking about how best to measure and disclose each of ESG’s distinctive components.
So how can we move forward on ESG reporting? We propose to start with a few important dimensions on which we can agree about what are “good” and “bad” outcomes and that we can already measure well. Of ESG’s three components, environmental is the most amenable to rigorous corporate reporting, because it involves objective, physical measurements of the amounts of gases, solids, and liquids that companies use and produce. This is good news, because the easiest component to measure presents the most urgent threat to humanity.

The U.S. Has a New Climate Goal. How Does It Stack Up Globally?
Updated April 22, 2021

The United States officially has a new goal for fighting climate change over the next decade. So how ambitious is it?
President Biden announced Thursday that America would aim to cut its greenhouse gas emissions 50 percent to 52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. That’s one of the more aggressive near-term targets among wealthy industrialized nations, although the cuts are arguably not quite as large as what the European Union and Britain have already promised.

Versus 2005

Comparing national pledges to cut emissions can be surprisingly tricky — a lot depends on the year you start counting from. The United States has decided to measure its reductions from 2005, which is roughly when the nation’s fossil fuel emissions reached a peak. But European countries tend to measure their reductions from 1990, when emissions began falling across the continent as a result of early climate policies and the collapse of polluting Communist economies in the East.
The later baseline makes the United States target look a bit better, because it omits a period when emissions were rising. An earlier baseline makes Europe look more ambitious, since it has been cutting for longer.
Mr. Biden unveiled the pledge at a White House climate summit for world leaders, declaring that the United States is ready to reclaim a leadership role on climate change. Japan also announced it would strengthen its climate targets , aiming for what translates to a 44 percent cut below 2005 levels by 2030. Canada also updated its climate goals, committing to a 40 percent to 45 percent cut below 2005 levels by 2030.
Ultimately, however, there’s one climate metric that matters most: How quickly the entire world can get to zero emissions and halt the warming of the planet.
To avoid many of the most catastrophic risks of climate change, such the collapse of polar ice sheets or widespread crop failures, scientists have said that the world likely needs to zero out emissions from fossil fuels and deforestation by around mid-century . “If the ultimate goal is zero emissions, then the metric we really care about is how quickly countries can get to zero,” said Kate Larsen, a director at Rhodium Group, an energy research and consulting firm.
On that score, the world is still falling far short.
While the United States and the European Union are both now vowing to get roughly halfway to zero by 2030 — on the way to net zero emissions by 2050 — they account for only one-quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. But many lower-income countries, including China and India, still expect their emissions to either plateau or keep rising over the next decade.

China, the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has pledged that its emissions will peak by around 2030. From that point, the country will then aim to get down to net zero emissions by 2060. China has also laid out some concrete targets , such as getting one-quarter of its electricity from low-carbon sources like wind, solar or nuclear power; planting vast new forests; and curbing the use of hydrofluorocarbons, a powerful greenhouse gas used as a refrigerant.
If all those targets are met, an analysis by the Rhodium Group found, China’s emissions could level off close to current levels by the end of the decade, although the exact numbers depend on how rapidly the country’s economy grows.
But China is not yet committing to specific cuts before 2030. China’s argument is that it was slower to industrialize than the United States and Europe, and therefore needs more time to pivot away from fossil fuels like coal. “When it comes to climate change response, China is at a different stage than the U.S., Western nations and other developed countries.” Le Yucheng, China’s vice foreign minister, said last week .
India, for its part, has not yet formally set a date for when its emissions will peak, though it has announced goals for increasing the use of cleaner energy sources like solar power and slowing its growth in fossil-fuel consumption. Officials there point out that India is still much poorer than the United States or Europe, and it is unfair to hold them to the same standard.

Indeed, looking at emissions per person tells a different story about which country is doing the most. Currently, the United States uses far more fossil fuels per person than almost any other country in the world, although China is quickly narrowing the gap.
If every country were to meet its stated climate goals, America’s per capita emissions would decline and converge with China’s by 2030, the Rhodium Group estimated. But both countries’ per capita emissions would still be twice that of Europe’s and nearly four times that of India’s.
Partly for that reason, some environmentalists have argued that the United States should have picked an even more ambitious target for reducing emissions. Doing so would not only make up for decades of being by far the world’s largest emitter, they argue, but would also give lower-income countries like India more time to transition off fossil fuels. One recent report by a range of civil society groups urged the United States to commit to a 70 percent cut by 2030, along with vast new funding for clean-energy projects in the developing world.
“If you’re asking whether the U.S. target is fair and ambitious, the right yardstick isn’t what will pass muster with the Senate,” said Sivan Kartha, a senior scientist at the Stockholm Environment Institute and a co-author of the report. “The question is what should the United States do given its capacity to act and its historical responsibility for causing the problem?”
Many Republicans in Congress have argued that the Biden administration is acting too aggressively on climate change when countries like China and India have yet to commit to absolute emissions cuts. Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, said that the president was “unilaterally committing America to a drastic and damaging emissions pledge” that would punish the U.S. economy while “America’s adversaries like China and Russia continue to increase emissions at will.”
The Biden administration’s calculus is that it should set a target that is both challenging to meet but also politically plausible. By doing so, officials say, they can persuade other countries to do more — both through diplomatic pressure and by driving down the cost of new low-carbon technologies, such as electric vehicles or hydrogen fuels, to make it easier for other countries to act.
It remains to be seen if the United States can pull that off.
The Biden administration invited more than 40 world leaders to this week’s climate summit with the hope that other countries might announce fresh commitments of their own. Mr. Biden has long vowed to transform the United States into a global leader on climate change, after the Trump administration had largely dismissed the issue for four years.
So far, the results have been mixed. Japan and Canada both agreed to strengthen their 2030 targets. The British government said Tuesday that it would step up action with a new target, cutting emissions 78 percent below 1990 levels by 2035. But other major emitters such as China, India and Russia have yet to offer significant new pledges.
The Biden administration also faces serious questions about whether it can actually meet its 2030 climate target, which unlike the pledges from the European Union or Britain, is not enshrined into law. After all, lofty goals on paper will achieve little unless they’re backed up by concrete action.
One recent study estimated that America’s greenhouse gas emissions have already fallen 21.5 percent between 2005 and 2020. Much of that was the result of electric utilities retiring their dirtiest coal plants in favor of cleaner and cheaper natural gas, wind and solar power. An additional one-third of cuts resulted from the coronavirus pandemic, because business activity slumped and people drove less. However, emissions are expected to rebound this year as the economy rumbles back to life.
To get at least a 50 percent cut by 2030, a variety of studies have found, the United States would need to adopt sweeping new policies and slash emissions each year at an unprecedented rate. Possible strategies include requiring utilities to install vastly more wind and solar power, persuading Americans to buy many more electric cars, and forcing oil and gas companies to slash emissions of methane, a potent heat-trapping gas. States like California and New York could help, too, by following through on their plans to clean up their power plants and vehicle fleets.
Mr. Biden has already proposed a number of new climate measures. His big infrastructure proposal , estimated at between $3 trillion and $4 trillion, includes tax incentives for clean energy and electric vehicles. Separately, the Environmental Protection Agency is looking at enacting stricter regulations for tailpipe pollution from cars and trucks and for methane emissions.
But none of those measures have passed into law yet. And they face an uncertain fate in Congress and the courts.
“There are a number of plausible pathways to hit that target, but it’s frankly going to be challenging,” said Nathan Hultman, director of University of Maryland’s Center on Global Sustainability who has modeled what a 50 percent cut would require. “We won’t be able to sit back and hope that market forces alone will do the job.”
Many countries face similar questions.
Canada, for instance, has pledged to cut emissions up to 45 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Its emissions have fallen just 1 percent , but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that the country’s adoption of a hefty new carbon tax would help meet the new targets. In Britain, environmental groups have warned that the nation’s ambitious promises have yet to be backed up by rigorous new policies.
There’s also the biggest uncertainty of all: Mr. Biden’s first term ends in 2024. What happens if he is succeeded by a president who abandons his climate targets, much as President Trump dismantled President Obama’s regulations on greenhouse gas emissions?
In the European Union and Britain, there’s a broader political consensus around climate policy that doesn’t change too drastically when different parties take power. But in nations like Australia, Canada or especially the United States, rival political parties often have sharply divergent views on how quickly they should cut emissions — or even whether it’s desirable to cut emissions at all.
“In countries where a change in government can derail the whole thing,” said Oliver Geden, a senior fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, “it’s a lot harder to be sure that these goals are here to stay.”
Notes: Charts show the carbon dioxide equivalent of net greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions and sinks from land use and forestry. Rhodium Group’s estimates of emissions data for each country from 1990 to 2019 includes all major greenhouse gases, consistent with national reporting to the United Nations. Emissions from international aviation and shipping are excluded from national figures.
Emissions trajectory charts for the United States and the European Union reflect pledged emissions cuts by 2030. For China and India, future emissions trajectories assume that both countries fulfill all of their publicly stated climate pledges and phase down hydrofluorocarbon gases in line with their commitments under the Montreal Protocol. The high end projections for China and India assume slightly faster annual economic growth than projected by the International Energy Agency through 2030, the low end assumes slightly slower growth.

Ozone layer recovery may take several lifetimes. But Montreal Protocol saved the Earth
The stratospheric ozone layer absorbs a portion of the ultraviolet radiation from the sun, preventing it from reaching the surface of Earth

The stratospheric ozone layer absorbs a portion of the ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun, preventing it from reaching the surface of Earth.
There are two types of ultraviolet rays that reach the earth’s surface — UVB and UVA. UVB rays are responsible for producing sunburn and can cause skin cancers, crop damage, etc.
Experiments on fish suggest that 90-95 per cent of malignant melanomas (a form of skin cancer) may be due to UVA & UVB radiations. Plants are sensitive to UV radiation below 300 nanometers.
Several commonly used chemicals have been found to be damaging to the stratospheric ozone layer .
Halocarbons are chemicals in which one or more carbon atoms are linked to one or more halogen atoms (fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine). Halocarbons containing bromine usually have much higher ozone-depleting potential (ODP) than those containing chlorine.
Man-made chemicals that have provided most of the chlorine and bromine for ozone depletion are methyl bromide, methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and families of chemicals known as halons and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
Ozone depletion also affects the climate , though the impact is not clearly understood. With its depletion, the spectrum of incoming radiation will change and the ozone layer may produce new molecular species that change the radiation-emitting and absorbing properties of the atmosphere.
This may cause the formation of more tropospheric ozone, which will not be desirable.
In the absence of the ozone layer, the radiations will directly flow to the earth’s surface and change the vertical distribution of molecules in the troposphere and stratosphere. This, in turn, will change the rate of vertical circulation.
In 1994, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed September 16 as World Ozone Day, commemorating the date of the signing of the Montreal Protocol in 1987. The theme for World Ozone Day, 2021 was Montreal Protocol: Keeping us, our food and vaccines cool.
As an international response in 1987 an international meeting in Montreal, Canada, produced the Montreal Protocol to phase out the use of CFCs by 2000. Montreal Protocol is an international treaty designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of substances that are responsible for ozone depletion.
CFC production in most developed countries has fallen sharply since 1989. The Montreal Protocol has been successful in reducing ozone-depleting substances and reactive chlorine and bromine in the stratosphere to avoid up to 0.4 degrees Celsius of global temperature rise.
CFCs are being substituted by HCFCs (hydrochlorofluorocarbons), which release much less chlorine per molecule.
The 2019 ozone hole is indeed the smallest it has been since 1982, when agencies started recording its size. But the ozone is also influenced by temperature shifts and dynamics in the atmosphere through climate change.
In 50 years or so, the stratospheric ozone levels are expected to be back to normal. However, the final recovery is expected to require several lifetimes.

Its revised guidelines say that companies should disclose their carbon emissions independently of a “materiality assessment”.
A materiality assessment refers to the process of identifying, refining and assessing the potential environmental, social and governance issues which could affect a business and its stakeholders.
According to a TCFD statement , the revised version upgrades seven categories of cross-sector indicator as particularly important for assessing financial impact. They are scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 GHG emissions, indicators of climate-related transitions and actual risks and opportunities, capital deployment, internal carbon pricing and remuneration, and disclosure on companies’ plans to ‘transition to a net zero economy’.
John Yeap of Pinsent Masons, the law firm behind Out-Law, said: “Reporting against the guidelines will involve not just compliance costs but also the availability of tools and agreed benchmarking standards. In this regard, the development of common standards such as on green taxonomy will help, and a wider base commitment will no doubt develop when companies are able to see closer correlation between market capitalisation and climate reporting.”
Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from the company’s activities or those under its control, scope 2 covers indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling consumed by the reporting company, and scope 3 emissions include all other indirect emissions which occur in a company’s value chain.
A South China Morning Post report said that this would “[pose] a challenge for businesses in Hong Kong”. 
In December a cross-agency steering group established by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced that it aims to align listed companies’ climate-related disclosures with TCFD recommendations by 2025.
The TCFD’s guidelines were published in 2017 and say that companies should undertake scenario-planning for different levels of global warming and should disclose medium and long term emissions targets.
The TCFD was established by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in 2015 to develop a set of voluntary, consistent disclosure recommendations for companies to use when providing information on climate-related financial risks to investors, lenders and insurance underwriters.

The Imperatives of India’s Climate Response
Sayanangshu Modak
As the global climate crisis intensifies, nations are becoming more hard-pressed to formulate responses that will be acceptable to all stakeholders. In an effort to understand India’s approach to addressing the challenges of climate change, this paper describes the natural circumstances that have historically shaped its responses. The paper also discusses the most crucial imperatives that have guided such actions and suggests that these will continue to play a dominant role in the future. The paper argues that any broad deviation from this course of action will not be sustainable as India’s natural circumstances continue to influence its economy and public life.

1. Introduction 
The global climate has warmed significantly over the past few decades owing largely to anthropogenic factors, and the ramifications of the crisis will be witnessed across the world. Thus, the response also requires a global effort, albeit with some nations expected and able to do more than others. This paper discusses India’s role in climate action, and underscores the circumstances and imperatives that will continue to guide India’s response.
The paper outlines the natural circumstances [a] of geography and resource endowments and discusses India’s historical response to them. It analyses the projected impacts of climate change on India and its responses thus far, through both domestic strategies and commitments to international instruments. The paper shows that India’s climate action has been largely commensurate with the impact that global warming is having on the country. It finds that India’s responses are shaped by its natural circumstances, and guided by its Constitution and civilisational ethos as well.
2. India’s Natural Circumstances: An Overview
In 2015, The Economist called India “a continent that is masquerading as a country.” [1] Indeed, the country is enormous and highly diverse in its biogeophysical, socioeconomic, and political composition.  Due to its vast expanse straddling two climatic zones – the equatorial and the temperate, as well as wide variations in topography and the strong influence of monsoonal circulations—the country’s climate is varied—extremely hot and dry in the deserts, and severely cold in the high-altitude regions. India has six climatic zones: hot and dry (Western Rajasthan, parts of peninsular India); warm and humid (the coastal regions, northeast India); moderate (pockets of Karnataka, Maharashtra); cold and cloudy (much of Himalaya and pockets of central, southern and northeast India); cold and sunny (Ladakh and Aravalis); and composite (bulk of Indo-Gangetic plain and Central India). [2] India experiences six climatic regimes: Tropical wet; Tropical wet and dry; arid; semi-arid; humid sub-tropical; and mountain. [3] Temperatures can range from 51 deg C in Rajasthan, to -60 deg C in Ladakh.
Indeed, the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) mountain range and the Tibetan Plateau is widely known as the ‘Third Pole’ because of their ice fields which has the largest freshwater reserve outside the polar regions. It presents seasonal and permanent frigid conditions in settlements at high altitudes like Lahaul and Spiti district, Himachal and the Union Territory of Ladakh. India also has one of the wettest places on Earth, while parts of the Thar desert may receive little or no rainfall for consecutive years.
The landforms are also highly varied and strategically located, creating distinct physiographic zones and influencing the agroecology of regions. India has seven physiographic zones (see also Figure 1).
The mountains of the north, comprising the Himalaya and other ranges, consist of marine sediments of calcareous origin, mostly limestone, which have been compressed and deformed by endogenic forces. They are among the youngest mountain ranges in the world.
The plains of North India were created by the deposition of sediments over millions of years by three main river systems – Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra. The thickness of sediments can be from one to five kilometres. [4]
The Central Highlands between the plains of the North and Deccan Plateau.
The Peninsular Plateaus comprising the Western and Eastern Ghats, Deccan Plateau (North and South), and Eastern Plateau. The Deccan volcanic province that records a massive accumulation of tholeiitic magmas in a relatively short period forming a thick igneous layer, is a significant geological feature in this zone.
The East Coast, 100-130-km wide.
The West Coast, narrower at 10-25 km.
The Lakshadeep Islands in the Arabian Sea and Andaman and Nicobar Island in the Bay of Bengal.

The bulk of the precipitation in India is derived from the monsoon. The northwest of India also receives some precipitation from the Western Disturbances that originate from the Mediterranean Sea.  The position of India near the tropic as well as the strategic location of the Himalaya forming a distinct arc along the country’s frontier from north to east is key in creating a monsoonal climate. The thermal concept of Indian monsoon laying out the heating of the northern plains during summer and the formation of a permanent thermally induced low pressure as well as the shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone to a position over the northern plains is well-known.  During the prevalence of monsoonal circulation, the chain of high mountains blocks the equatorial maritime air masses from the south-west to crossover and, instead, forces them to curve to the north-west of India. Similarly, it prevents the cold air masses from the Tibetan Plateau in the northwest to enter South Asia during winter.
Within this highly skewed annual precipitation regime that largely consists of four months of monsoonal rains, the distribution of rains across space and time is also variable. Geographically, localised heavy rains are associated with orographic barriers while regionally they occur due to the shift of the monsoon trough. Temporally, there is also a very high interannual variability of rainfall associated with the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-modulating Indian monsoon, with less than normal rain during El Niño phases and more than normal rain during La Niña phases. The intra-annual variability occurs due to two main factors – the intensity of cyclones during monsoon and the number of monsoon break days. This may lead to regions experiencing a deficit of rainfall in the beginning, middle or end of the season. Cyclones mostly occur during the post-monsoon period and have been traditionally more frequent in the Bay of Bengal rim, affecting the eastern coast of India.

Concomitantly, variability of temperature and rainfall is an intrinsic part of the climate of India. The climate also influences the type and availability of natural capital such as forests, water, and soil. For example, the variability of temperature, rainfall and humidity has created five groups of forests – Moist tropical (west coast, east coast and eastern Himalaya); dry tropical (northern hilly regions and parts of south India); montane temperate (Northern middle Himalaya); montane sub-tropical (northeast India and the Western Ghats); and alpine (Himalayan region and TransHimalaya). India also has a wide variety of soil types that have also largely determined the predominant crop type of a region. Defined by the physiography and geology along with the prevalent climatic regime, the river channels also show a distinct character in terms of being perennial or not and their physical characteristics such as form or pattern. For instance, the Himalayan rivers are largely perennial, in contrast to the rivers of peninsular India. Similarly, the channel may have strong structural controls as in the case of a gorge with a high gradient or it may have more room to meander as in the case of floodplains.
The geological history of India is unique. India was part of the Gondwana supercontinent, sharing the landmass with Africa, Australia, and Antarctica. Around 120 million years ago, the Indian plate broke off and started migrating north; 50 million years ago, it rammed into the Eurasian plateau, thereby creating the Himalayas. [7] The Himalayas are perennially rising by more than 1 cm per year as a result of active tectonics. [8] Shallow-focus earthquakes in the region are common which, along with hazards caused by exogenous forces leading to flash floods and landslides, pose serious challenges for hydropower development despite the abundance of the hydrological gradient.
The geology of India is also extremely peculiar and a donnée in shaping the country’s mineral resource endowments. The bulk of the valuable minerals are the products of processes predating the Palaeozoic age and are largely associated with igneous and metamorphic formations. Therefore, the large tract of alluvial plain in the north is largely devoid of minerals, while most of the economically valuable metallic minerals occur within the old crystalline rocks of the peninsular plateau. India has large endowments of Iron ore in the form of Haematite and magnetite. About 79 percent of haematite is found in the Eastern sector (Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha) while 93 percent of magnetite deposits occur in the Southern Sector (Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu). [9] Another important mineral that aids in the preparation of steel is Manganese; India accounts for 8 percent of the global manganese ore reserves. [10] Deposits of Manganese are largely in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Gujarat.
India also has widespread and substantial deposits of dolomites, limestone, and bauxite.   In a report by the International Energy Association (IEA) in May 2021, a number of critical minerals have been identified which are required for rapid deployment in order to make energy transition. [11] Most of these critical minerals, like Copper, Lithium, Nickel, Cobalt, and Rare earths, are not found in  viable quantities in India. However, the country has some reserves of chromium, silicon and manganese. The non-metallic minerals, such as mica, limestone, and dolomite, are available sufficiently, albeit in isolated pockets.
In energy resources, India has adequate coal deposits (9.5 percent of the global reserve), but very little petroleum (0.3 percent) and natural gas (1 percent). [12] Occurring mainly in two stratigraphic horizons – Permian sediments deposited in Intratectonic Gondwana basins and Early Tertiary in near-shore peri-cratonic basins and shelves. The Gondwana coal that occurs in the Eastern and Central parts of Peninsular India is of the bituminous type with moderate to High Ash content and low sulphur. The bulk of India’s coal is of this type and is considered high-grade, concentrated in the Damodar, Godavari, Mahanadi and Sone River valleys, thus, largely confined to the eastern sector. The Tertiary coal found in North-eastern India has high Sulphur content and ranges from strongly caking to non-caking. India also has the lignite variety of coal in Western and Southern India which is high in moisture and volatile matter and therefore, inferior in quality.
Crude petroleum occurs in sedimentary rocks of the tertiary period. The oil deposits are mostly scattered at the eastern and western frontiers of the country such as Digboi, Naharkatiya and Moran in Assam and the oilfields of Ankaleshwar, Kalol, Mehsana in Gujarat. Oil deposits were also discovered in 1973 at a location about 160 km off the Mumbai coast, which became Mumbai High. Natural Gas is obtained along with oil in all oilfields but exclusive reserves have also been identified which are scattered along the eastern coast as well as Tripura, Rajasthan and elsewhere. Despite India’s large land surface area, its extractable hydrocarbon reserves remain meagre. Nearly 76 percent of the hydrocarbon discovered so far in India are in rocks of Tertiary age, 20 percent in Mesozoic, and the rest in older rocks. This is counterintuitive, as globally the finds of hydrocarbons shown a reversal of occurrence with a high probability of occurrence in the Mesozoic strata. Plausible reasons could be attributed to geological factors. For instance, the formation of the thick, impervious layer of igneous rocks over western and central India after the Mesozoic era could be concealing the hydrocarbon endowments and making extraction unfeasible. [13] Similarly, the thick layer of sediments in the Indo-Gangetic Plains makes the underlying geology largely unreachable. Further, with the Himalayan orogeny, it may have happened that the sedimentary oil-bearing column got largely exhumed and deformed due to the rapid movement of the Indian plate and the violent uplift event. [14] Thus, with severe limitations on conventional sources of fuel except for coal, India has been exploring non-conventional sources of energy such as nuclear since its independence.
India has a rather modest reserve of Uranium at 1,84,964 tonnes, [15] which constitutes only about 2 percent of the global availability of Uranium. Deposits of uranium are concentrated in four regions of India – Meghalaya, Singhbhum (Chotanagpur), Cuddapah basin (Andhra Pradesh/Telangana) and Rohil North Delhi fold belt. In contrast to the availability of Uranium, India has one of the highest thorium reserves in the world that mostly occurs as the mineral monazite in beach sand along the eastern and western coast. However, Uranium remains the mainstay of the nuclear energy industry since the technology to use it as a nuclear fuel is more developed. [16] However, India remains committed to study how to use Thorium as a nuclear fuel. [17] Thorium is also safer than Uranium and produces far less radioactive waste in volumetric terms during its use, while the waste is also less radioactive and comparatively short-lived.
The realisation of the above energy resource endowment into power generation is captured in Figure 3.

3. India’s Response to its Natural Circumstances
Ancient Era to 1947
Across the globe, societies have adapted to their environment’s prevalent conditions of climate or water endowments. The emergence of the Indus Valley Civilisation along the fertile floodplains of the Indus and its tributaries with a distinctive regional culture, as against the sedentary farming cultures that predated it, is testimony to this harmonious relationship. The people of the Indus Valley Civilisation generated surplus grains that supported the urban dwellers. Rainwater harvesting was effectively practised during that time, which played a key role in the development of agriculture. [19] Monsoons have continued to remain important for the Indian population despite progress in expanding the irrigation coverage to delink the farmer’s dependence on these seasonal rains.
Indeed, India has traditionally had three agricultural seasons and Kharif (summer crop) has remained the most important, constituting much of the net sown area in the country. Moreover, as the country was predominantly rain-fed for much of its history, distinct food geographies evolved based on the hydrometeorological specificities of the region. Therefore, coarse grains such as sorghum, millets, maize, and barley are equally part of the Indian platter as rice and wheat and have been grown in the semi-arid areas like Rajasthan, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, and Odisha.
Since Indian society was largely adapted to floods, the damages from seasonal inundations in the floodplains could be kept at a minimum. For instance, in the floodplains of North Bihar, the aghani rice is grown in the land that is susceptible to flooding since it could withstand partial and temporary inundation provided that floods did not arrive without warning and the process of inundation was slow. [20] Similarly, in various parts of the flood-affected parts of the Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna basin, a number of indigenous strategies are applied—ranging from storing excess floodwaters in tanks to building houses on stilts, to altogether moving to safer heights and allowing the water to inundate the land for a bountiful-harvest in the post-monsoon season. [21] Floodplains were exceptionally productive due to the systemic wetting and drying. Therefore, floods were less of a concern except for the rare deluge. Land use change in the floodplains was limited, as was the growth of human settlements and agricultural land. Thus, the vulnerability was limited and adaptation could be achieved with locally procured resources and locally devised means. However, the story of another hydrological extreme – drought, is a different one.
As mentioned earlier, agricultural production in India has been intrinsically tied to the monsoons and the adequacy of rains. As such, the arid or semi-arid areas within the hinterland and in the rain-shadow of mountain ranges are less water-endowed. Life in these regions has thus evolved to accommodate the scarcity, be it the grains that were traditionally grown or the behavioural aspects of water use for various purposes. However, a crisis situation would still occur during the time of a meteorological drought. [b] This is linked with global and regional factors such as the ENSO phenomenon. At least 18 meteorological droughts occurred in India between 1870 and 2018; all the severe ones were due to ENSO. [22] Often, deficit rains for consecutive years increased the difficulty in the rural and agrarian landscape as there would be no respite from crippling food grain shortage, reduced fodder for animals, and shortage of drinking water and seeds. On the rare occasion of the transfer of these basic needs from neighbouring areas that had a surplus, people would be left with no option but to migrate. Thus, drought was feared more than floods, sometimes even in fertile regions like the Bengal delta.
The history of different regions of India is replete with the ancient wisdom of rainwater harvesting to reduce the impact of hydrological droughts even if a meteorological drought were to occur. In the arid parts of western Rajasthan, the task is done using saucer-shaped Kunds in privately owned land or land owned by caste groups. A kund with an area coverage of 100 m2, and with an annual rainfall of 100 mm, could easily collect 10000 litres of water. [23] Similarly, Khadins, Nadis, Talabs, Virdas, Bandha, and Johad are all traditional ways of harvesting rainwater and increasing the infiltration of water for the replenishment of groundwater. In the water-endowed parts, the issue was effective transportation of water and local innovations were devised; in Meghalaya, for example, a network of bamboo pipes is used to transport water from perennial sources. [24] In the apatani system of Arunachal Pradesh, the irrigation system was designed in such a way as to tap into several small streams and springs through small and rudimentary structural interventions for wet rice cultivation along with fish farming. [25] Similarly, Ghuls of Western Himalaya, the Zabo and Cheo-ozihi of Nagaland, the Dongs and Garh/Dara of Brahmaputra valley, and the Ahar Pynes of Bihar are all traditional arrangements of adapting to the conditions of water endowments and optimising their use.
Throughout India’s history, statecraft regarding the duties of Kings also mandated carrying out welfare activities. Pivotal to such activities were the construction and maintenance of structures for storing water for different uses. Thus, irrigation tanks, bunds and canals were constructed by the State to reduce the vagaries and uncertainties of water availability. Examples include the network of aqueducts and canals of Hampi under the Vijayanagara kingdom, [26] the indirect forms of human adjustment to water and climatic hazards under the Mughals through adjustments in land revenue policies, infrastructure development, administrative reform, human mobility, and landscape interpretation. [27] At times of drought or flood, land revenue remission (annewari) would be done, as well as providing crop/taccavi loans.
During the British era, the colonisers implemented measures to mitigate the vagaries of monsoon, with its successive cycles of floods, cyclones and droughts.  The Indian Meteorological Department was set up in 1875 after a massive tropical cyclone in 1864 and two episodes of failures of rains in 1866 and 1871. The British enhanced irrigated areas through a network of canals, took measures for storage of grains and provision of relief to tackle droughts. They also put in place a network of railways and roads, meant basically for the military and other needs of the colonisers. Scientific mineral exploration was also initiated which, for example, led to the discovery of sizeable coal and iron ore reserves in Eastern India and significant oil reserves in Assam. Yet the health of the economy in general, and the farmers in particular, still depended on the vagaries of the Indian Monsoon when the British left in 1947.
The technology to harness the potential of India’s mineral wealth and transport it over long distances arrived with the industrial age. However, the role and significance of minerals in shaping the economy and culture date back to ancient times. India has had an illustrious history of innovations and mastery with metallic minerals of various kinds, with uses largely localised.  Ferrous metallurgy was particularly advanced, reaching its zenith in the first millennium AD. The Iron Pillar at Mehrauli, New Delhi, is a particularly good example of this advancement because it has withstood rusting and consequent corrosion for about 1600 years. [28] Similarly, the ingenious method of downward distillation of zinc vapour post-smelting to obtain zinc metal is also elaborated in the 13th-century text, Rasa Rasaratnasamuccaya. [29]
Until the middle of the 19th century both for fuel and lighting, firewood, wood charcoal, vegetable oil and biomass (straws and twigs) were used. Nothing was wasted, as cow dung patties were used as fuel for cooking in the Indo-Gangetic plains. The age of steam/industrialisation arguably got delayed in India due to the non-discovery of mineable/ viable coal reserves, let alone hydrocarbons, till the late 19th century. 
Post-Independence
After Independence in 1947, India adopted a federal system of government, where power would be shared between the Union Government and the State Governments, with some centralising tendency. It also made sure that egalitarianism was an intrinsic part of India by including a chapter on fundamental rights in the Constitution. Articles 14, 15 and 16, in particular, relate to the rights to equality, against discrimination, and to equal opportunities. Owing to the humongous task of accommodating the demographic diversity while striving for social and economic justice at the same time, the framers of the Indian Constitution recognised the need for a set of principles to show India a general direction. Thus emerged the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP), whose aim is to establish the country as a welfare state. Article 39 (b) of the Indian Constitution provides that the ownership and material resources of the community are to be distributed in ways that will best serve the common good. [c]
This perhaps embodied the concept of “sustainable development” long before the term was institutionalised by the United Nations (UN) in the 1980s. In 1972, India was  represented by its head of government at the first-ever UN Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm. [30] Championing the cause of environmental protection, India’s Prime Minister Indira Gandhi took the occasion of the conference to remark, “There are grave misgivings that the discussion on ecology may be designed to distract attention from the problems of war and poverty. We have to prove to the disinherited majority of the world that ecology and conservation will not work against their interest but will bring an improvement in their lives.” [31] Subsequently, two additions were made to DPSP. In 1976, through the 42nd amendment to the Indian Constitution, Article 48A was added which directs the states to protect and improve the environment and safeguard the country’s forests and wildlife. Article 51A was also added to prescribe that the fundamental duty of every citizen was to protect and improve the natural environment and have compassion for living creatures. Forest, as an item, was shifted from the state list to the concurrent list, enabling the union government to enact legislation regarding forests as well as wildlife.
The translation of constitutional imperatives into laws that looked to safeguard the environment also took place in the 1970s and 1980s. The first such law was the Water Prevention and Control of Pollution Act in 1974, followed by a similar one for Air in 1981. The Bhopal Gas Tragedy of 1984 made it more urgent to frame holistic laws that dealt with the environment. In 1986 the Environmental Protection Act (EPA) was passed, marking a shift from controlling pollution to protecting the environment. Thereafter, the EPA acted as the basis for various subordinate legislation for environmental impact assessment and coastal regulation, among other measures. The provisions of the EPA were framed in a manner that actions pursuant to international treaty commitments could also be taken thereunder, such as the Designated National Authority under the Montreal Protocol of the Vienna Convention on Ozone Depleting Substances.
In the 1990s, several Public Interest Litigations (PILs) were filed in High Courts and Supreme Courts that led to the passing of some fundamental and far-reaching directives for the control of air pollution, mining pollution, and deforestation. Parallel to this environment-related legislation, the Parliament enacted the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, no longer treating forests as resources to be exploited but as national endowments to be protected and conserved. Specialised tribunals were also set up, like the National Green Tribunal in 2010, that sought to apply natural law like “precautionary principle” or “polluter pays principle” to the national economy.
Social and economic development were also clear priorities for the newly constituted government after independence. Thus, the Soviet-style Five-Year Plans (FYPs) were initiated in 1951 as centralised and integrated national economic programmes. The long-term objectives were to increase the GDP and per capita income, raise employment levels, achieve self-sufficiency of commodities and food grains, promote social justice, reduce inequalities, and pursue modernisation. To achieve these objectives, three strands of development initiatives emerged: human development, industrial development, and development of infrastructure. While the first FYP sought to achieve self-sufficiency in food grains, the second one implemented the Nehru-Mahalanobis model of rapid industrialisation. [d] The subsequent six FYPs, until the liberalisation of the Indian economy in 1991, sought to strengthen agricultural growth and ensure economic stability while focusing on poverty eradication.
Under the first five-year plan, multi-purpose river valley development projects were initiated to augment surface water and transport it efficiently to increase the irrigation coverage of the country. This was imperative for the development of the agricultural sector, and brought key co-benefits like flood-control and hydropower generation. The Bhakra-Nangal multipurpose dam and the subsequent Indira Gandhi Canal, Damodar valley project, and Hirakud Dam Project, were all implemented during this period. The nation continued to face acute food grain shortages and was dependent on food grain imports, mainly from the United States (US). [32] This changed with the advent of the Green Revolution in the late 1960s. A crucial input that helped the Green Revolution succeed was the timely, adequate and assured supply of water. This was ensured by the proliferation of borewells which helped to add 11 million hectares to the net irrigated area, even as the area irrigated by surface water expanded only by 3 million hectares during the same period. [33] Despite all these efforts, 51 percent of the net sown area remains rain-fed, [34] the concerned farmers and the local economy continuing to be exposed to the impacts of temporal and spatial monsoon variability. The serious water stress is compounded by the ever-increasing requirement of water for human use, mostly in urban areas; industrial use and the discharge of untreated wastewater; and a decline in water quality whenever the annual rainfall is inadequate.
In the pre-liberalisation phase, India also grappled with the challenges of energy insecurity. Coal resources being concentrated in the eastern part of the country, shipping coal to thermal power plants located all over the country, imposed transport costs. Further, importing coal/ oil freely was problematic at that time due to various factors including foreign exchange shortage and port capacity constraints. From the early decades of Independence, therefore, hydropower, nuclear power and solar/ wind energy were sought to be promoted as much as the scarce financial resources permitted. However, nuclear power development was constrained due to the limited availability of technology and fissile materials. Solar power generation also suffered from the low efficiency of solar cells and grid-related constraints. Similarly, large hydropower projects were beset by public resistance due to land-related issues and high upfront capital costs. The Oil Crisis of the early 1970s was a wake-up call when serious energy security concerns, vis-a-vis hydrocarbon, became evident. It resulted in the management of demand through organisations like the Petroleum Conservation Research Association (PCRA), which promoted energy efficiency and higher taxation.
In 1991 and through the subsequent FYP (1992-97), the country entered a new phase of economic growth through fiscal and economic reforms, including liberalisation. As the share of the industrial and service sectors in the economy increased, energy production had to keep pace with the high demand and consumption of energy (see Figure 4). This demand, in turn, was primarily driven by energy-intensive sectors with low energy-efficiency like power generation, steel, cement, refineries, chemicals, fertilisers, and transport. The growth rate of Total Primary Energy Consumption (TPEC) outstripped GDP growth rate, and the gap between TPEC and Total Energy Production (TEP) widened towards the beginning of the 2000s (see Figure 4). The demand and consumption of coal and hydrocarbons also increased manifold during this phase. According to estimates, oil imports tripled within a decade, from 500 Kb/d in 1990 to 1.54 Mb/d in 2000. Coal imports also tripled and the share of domestic coal consumption met by imports rose from under 4 percent to 8.3 percent. [35]

Soon enough, concern for energy security grew and the Indian government took initiatives towards the diversification of energy sources along with regulatory mechanisms like increased efficiency and enhanced conservation.  These circumstances made it imperative for the government to actively seek ways of decoupling energy consumption from economic growth, even as it looked for alternatives such as renewable energy. [e] India’s primary energy intensity of GDP has also declined consistently since the 1990s. The Energy Conservation Act 2001 was enacted under which the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) was set up. A new Electricity Act was enacted in 2003, which among other reforms permitted the stipulation of renewable energy purchase obligations on the distribution companies or discoms.
Furthermore, energy conservation rose with the launch of the government programme in 2006 to provide standards and labels on energy-saving and cost-saving potential of 21 selected appliances of different brands. This was followed by the Energy Conservation Building Codes in 2007 (ECBC), Agriculture Demand Side Management (DSM) in 2010, and Municipal DSM in 2015 that targeted various sectors. [37] India has also taken strides in developing the renewable energy sector, especially solar. The expansion of renewable energy has been a key thrust of successive governments.
At the turn of the 21st century, India was struck by three massive disasters: the Odisha super cyclone (1999); Gujarat earthquake (2001); and the Indian Ocean tsunami (2004). This propelled the political leadership across party lines to recast the weak disaster management system that was in place. Parliament enacted the Disaster Management Act in 2005 as a foundational legislation that lays a comprehensive framework enabling governing bodies to be created at the national, state, district and other local levels to discharge assigned tasks and responsibilities towards the management of disasters. At the apex level, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) was constituted to formulate policies and approve the national plan for disaster management. The states were no longer the final authority in formulating their respective plans and had to follow the broad guidelines laid out by NDMA. [38] This coordinated, structured approach was a marked departure from pre-2004. [f]
It is well-established that population levels and growth rates are key drivers of the consumption of energy and other resources. India’s population has steadily risen while the decadal population growth rate continues to decline—from 24.8 percent during 1961–71 to 21.3 percent from 1991 to 2001, and 17.6 percent, 2001–2011. Today India has a potentially massive demographic dividend: it has a huge youthful population who are aspirational and who could benefit from the rapid economic growth of the kind that has been experienced in the last three decades.
At the same time, India remains largely rural; in the rural districts, essential infrastructure needed to achieve aspirations remain inadequate. Deep penetration of technology and cellular connectivity has only enabled the juxtaposition of these two grossly unequal faces of growth. Thus, India faces both challenges and opportunities in terms of managing its youthful population while sustaining on the path of poverty alleviation and steady economic growth, with social and economic justice for all.
To be sure, India has achieved remarkable progress since independence. Many of the development indicators had improved by the time the country adopted a National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) in 2008. However, it still has a long way to go (see Table 1).

The first few days of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) have seen a flurry of announcements from world leaders promising to tackle climate change — from plans to phase out public finance for coal-fired power, to a pledge to end deforestation. This year, many big names — including US President Joe Biden and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi — attended the first two days of the conference to make big announcements.
COP26 climate summit: A scientists’ guide to a momentous meeting
This is different from what has happened at most previous COP summits, says Beth Martin, a specialist in climate negotiation who is part of RINGO (Research and Independent Non-Governmental Organizations), a network of organizations allowed to observe the COP26 negotiations. Usually, the highest-profile figures aren’t present during the first week, but arrive near the end of the meeting to help bridge differences in time for an agreed statement, and for the obligatory ‘UN family photo’.
Nature asked researchers what they think of the pledges that have been made so far, as negotiators from some 200 countries prepare to dive into more detailed talks.
Methane emissions
One of the key developments in the first week was an agreement to curb emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that is second only to carbon dioxide in terms of its impact on the climate. Led by the United States and the European Union, the global methane pledge seeks to curb methane emissions by 30% by 2030, and has been signed by more than 100 countries.
Control methane to slow global warming — fast
“Obviously, as a scientist you’d say, ‘Well, a 50% reduction in the methane emissions by 2030 would be even better,’ but it’s a good start,” says Tim Lenton, who heads the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter, UK. “It’s an additional lever that could really help us limit warming.”
Research has shown 1 that curbing methane emissions using existing technologies could shave up to 0.5 °C off global temperatures by 2100 . As with carbon dioxide, however, limiting methane emissions will not happen on its own.
With his climate agenda facing challenges in Congress, Biden made methane a centrepiece of his commitments in Glasgow by announcing a new regulation to curb methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. Put forward this week by the US Environmental Protection Agency, the rule would require companies to curb methane emissions from their facilities by 74% over the coming decade, compared with 2005 levels. If implemented as proposed, it could prevent the release of some 37 million tonnes of methane by 2035 — equivalent to more than the annual carbon emissions from the nation’s fleets of passenger vehicles and commercial aircraft.
India’s net-zero goal
After delaying expected updates to India’s climate commitments by more than a year, Modi captured the world’s attention early in the summit by announcing that his country would seek to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070 . The deadline is decades after that of many other countries that have made net-zero commitments, and it remains unclear whether India is committing to curbing just carbon dioxide emissions, or the broader category of greenhouse-gas emissions. But scientists say the announcement could mark a significant step forward if India follows through.
Scientists cheer India’s ambitious carbon-zero climate pledge
“We are definitely taken by surprise: this is much more than we were expecting to hear,” says Ulka Kelkar, an economist in Bengaluru who heads the Indian climate programme for the World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank based in Washington DC.
Many scientists remain sceptical about mid-century net-zero pledges, in part because it’s easy to make long-term promises but hard to make the difficult short-term decisions that are required to meet those pledges. But India’s commitment includes measurable near-term targets, such as a pledge to provide 50% of the nation’s power through renewable resources and to reduce projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030.
Questions remain about how these targets will be defined and measured, but models indicate that there is a 50% chance such net-zero pledges could limit global warming to 2 °C or less , if fully implemented by all countries.

Climate cash
Among a cascade of climate-finance announcements this week is a pledge from more than 450 organizations in the financial sector — including banks, fund managers and insurance companies — in 45 countries to move US$130 trillion of funds under their control into investments where the recipient is committed to net-zero emissions by 2050 .
The pledging institutions, which are part of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, have not yet specified interim targets or timetables to achieve this goal. On 1 November, UN secretary-general António Guterres announced that a group of independent experts would be convened to propose standards for such commitments to net-zero emissions.
The broken $100-billion promise of climate finance – and how to fix it
Governments also announced new investments in clean technologies . And more than 40 countries, including the United Kingdom, Poland, South Korea and Vietnam, have committed to phasing out coal power in the 2030s (for major economies) or 2040s (globally), and to stopping public funding for new coal-fired power plants.
“All of this is significant,” says Cristián Samper, an ecologist and president of the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York City. “The involvement of the financial sector and of ministers of finance and energy” in the meeting “is a game-changer”.
However, the announcements have been overshadowed by governments’ failure to meet a 2009 pledge to provide $100 billion annually in climate finance for low- and middle-income countries by 2020. Reports suggest that it will take another two years to reach this goal , and that around 70% of the finance will be provided as loans.
“We all assumed it would be grant finance. We didn’t pay attention to the fine print or expect that developed countries would hide behind loans,” says climate economist Tariq Banuri, a former director of sustainable development at the UN.
Ending deforestation
More than 130 countries have pledged to halt and reverse forest-loss and land degradation by 2030. The signatories, which include Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Indonesia, are home to 90% of the world’s forests.
It is not the first such commitment: the 2014 New York Declaration on Forests , signed by a broad coalition of nearly 200 countries, regional governments, companies, indigenous groups and others, called for halving deforestation by 2020 and “striving” to end it by 2030.
The United Nations must get its new biodiversity targets right
There is also a long-standing UN pledge to slow down and eventually reverse the loss of biodiversity . But this remains unfulfilled and there is no official monitoring. Researchers say the latest target is unlikely to be met without an enforcement mechanism.
Separately, a group of high-income countries has pledged $12 billion in public finance for forest protection between 2021 and 2025 , but has not specified how the funding will be provided. A statement from the group, which includes Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and EU countries, says governments will “work closely with the private sector” to “leverage vital funding from private sources to deliver change at scale”. This suggests that the finance is likely to be dominated by loans.
Still, Samper says that there are reasons to be optimistic. Few previous climate COPs discussed nature and forests on the scale now seen in Glasgow. In the past, if biodiversity was mentioned at a climate meeting, “it was like the Martians had landed”, he says, because biodiversity and climate are treated as separate challenges by the UN. “We’ve never seen this much attention. It could be a pivot point.”

Switzerland’s bilateral agreements to offset their emissions set a poor precedent for ambition ahead of COP26

Switzerland has reached agreements with Georgia1, Peru2, Senegal and Ghana3 to support the implementation of low-hanging fruit climate change mitigation. In return, the countries will transfer the mitigation outcomes to Switzerland to help it meet its national target under the Paris Agreement. The agreements send no signal for decarbonisation in Switzerland, while for the countries hosting the emission reductions the agreements close some of their best available options to implement their NDCs and raise ambition in the future.
Transferring credits for “low-hanging” emission reductions does not constitute an ambition raising mechanism in the context of the Paris Agreement. If other rich nations – whose collective targets are already way short of levels needed to avoid catastrophic climate change – follow this precedent, then countries most in need of climate finance could run out of accessible avenues to deliver climate action, while facilitating inaction on the part of those that need to take leadership.
Switzerland would set a better example for driving global climate action by fulfilling its fair share of international climate finance contributions to support activities in the countries it is partnering with, without claiming ownership of the emission reduction outcomes in return.
Ambition raising mechanisms under the Paris Agreement require a shift from the low- to the high-hanging fruit of mitigation action.
At COP26, Parties aim to develop the rules and modalities for how countries may use voluntary cooperation based on Article 6 to support ambition raising under the Paris Agreement. Although those negotiations continue with many unresolved issues, it was already agreed in 2015 that voluntary cooperation between Parties with transfers of mitigation outcomes under the Paris Agreement should serve a different purpose to those under the Kyoto protocol: these should be ambition raising mechanisms rather than flexibility mechanisms4. Two criteria – among many others – are essential for market mechanisms to play an ambition raising function in the context of the global governance framework of the Paris Agreement:
The abatement costs of projects supported in third countries should be high enough to send a signal for decarbonisation in the credit buying country, rather than a continuation of business as usual. For orientation, the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices identified that the transition to a 1.5 °C compatible trajectory would require a global average price signal of at least USD 40-80 per tCO2e in 2020, rising to at least USD 50-100 by 20305. Prices in the European carbon market – which Switzerland is linked to – are around USD 70 per tCO2e today.
The projects supported should be sufficiently ambitious that they avoid presenting any conflict with the host country’s own ambition. More specifically, exporting emission reduction outcomes should not block the way for unilateral ambition raising in the host country, and prospective transactions should not present the host country with a perverse incentive to restrict its unilateral ambition.
This essentially means shifting focus from the low-hanging fruit – the main target for market mechanisms under the Kyoto flexibility mechanisms – to the high-hanging fruit of mitigation action. This high-hanging fruit is beyond the reasonable reach of unilateral action on the part of the host country, unlocks finance for the hard-to-abate emission sources that remain largely unaddressed, and sets a meaningful price signal for prospective market participants to reduce their own emissions first. This must define the benchmark for the additionality of projects under an ambition raising mechanism in the context of the Paris Agreement.
Through its bilateral agreements, Switzerland positions itself to buy up the low-hanging fruits of mitigation potential from other countries, while simultaneously not fulfilling its fair share of international climate finance contributions.
Switzerland’s recently announced agreement with Georgia envisages the provision of financial support for energy efficiency retrofits of large public buildings, in return for the international transfer of mitigation outcomes to offset Switzerland’s emissions.
The renovation of public buildings remains one of the most accessible mitigation options in Georgia. Further action in this sector can be implemented at reasonable – in some cases negative – abatement costs6. A range of complex barriers in the residential building sector has led to inaction, but many of these obstacles are less relevant for larger public buildings. For this sub-sector, where action has been prioritised by the Sustainable Energy Action Plans of Georgia’s major cities for more than a decade, inaction is due to chronic underinvestment and inactivity on the part of the Georgian government as well as international support providers. Georgia already committed to further action in this sector under the international treaty with the European Union7, legislated in the 2020 Law of Georgia on Energy Efficiency8. The same legislation is covered under the measures of Georgia’s NDC implementation plan9.
The currently envisaged activities of the agreement cannot support ambition raising in either country. For Switzerland, the relatively low abatement costs of the measures referred to in the announcement can send no meaningful signal to address own emissions first and strive for further decarbonisation at home. For Georgia, the agreement to transfer emission reductions to Switzerland and apply corresponding adjustments to their emissions balance could threaten one of their most accessible options for NDC implementation and domestic ambition raising.
The poor state of the building sector is a key source of greenhouse gas emissions, as well as poverty in Georgia, and has proven difficult to address. Climate finance could lead to significant mitigation and socioeconomic benefits. But developed countries already have a responsibility to provide more financial support for climate action, without claiming the mitigation outcomes of that support as their own and blocking the path for host country ambition. ODI analysis shows that Switzerland’s contributions to international climate finance fall 38% short of what would be their fair share to the internationally agreed goal to mobilise USD 100 billion of public international climate finance per year10. The Climate Action Tracker recently assessed Switzerland’s climate finance contributions, finding them highly insufficient11. Georgia’s building sector would be a good candidate for such support: Georgia’s neighbour Armenia secured financing of USD 116 million for the energy efficiency retrofit of buildings through the GCF in 2016.
Unambitious plans for the use of international market mechanisms set a poor precedent. Widespread replication of such approaches could significantly threaten collective ambition under the Paris Agreement.
Switzerland’s bilateral agreement with Georgia may be modest in scale but should not be dismissed as insignificant at the international level. The agreement follows in the vein of Switzerland’s other bilateral agreements – which include support for biogas in Senegal, solar PV and energy efficient lighting in Ghana, and industrial energy efficiency in Peru – as well as other Article 6 pilot programmes pursued by the Swedish Energy Agency.
As an early actor in Paris market mechanisms, Switzerland’s bilateral agreements set a low bar for other countries potentially considering their use, and a poor precedent ahead of the resumption in negotiations on Article 6. If any forthcoming rules on Article 6 allow countries to follow this precedent, then this could quickly lead to a situation where developing countries run out of avenues to deliver domestic climate change mitigation action, while offering a cheap option for rich nations to avoid implementing urgent climate action at home. This does not deliver the urgent, transformative raising of climate ambition that Article 6 cooperation and wider provisions for climate finance in the Paris Agreement must achieve.
There is a more constructive way to pursue bilateral cooperation. Countries should fulfil the fair share of their climate finance contributions and reserve the use of market mechanisms for the hardest-to-abate emission sources.
To deliver on the ambitious goals that nations signed up to in 2015, the evidence is clear that we need urgent, ambitious climate action now to transform our economies. We’re likely to need all the tools in the box to meet this challenge and international market mechanisms – if designed robustly – can play a role in unlocking truly inaccessible mitigation potential in countries with more limited resources to address those emission sources.
Before reaching for international market mechanisms today, countries need to ensure they have their own house in order. This starts with two key steps: doubling down on targets for domestic decarbonisation; and fulfilling a fair share contribution to public international climate finance. Countries that fulfil their fair share contributions to international climate finance commitments – or even go beyond these commitments with further contributions – can more constructively support global climate action by leaving the mitigation outcomes with the host country, thereby supporting rather than conflicting with host country climate ambition.
Countries that want to go beyond this to participate in bilateral or multilateral cooperation with the international transfer of mitigation outcomes should strive to deliver the high-hanging fruit of mitigation action. This can best ensure that market-based cooperation can fulfil its purpose as an ambition raising mechanism. In this regard, Switzerland still has the chance to ensure that the final selection of specific projects implemented via its bilateral agreements is more ambitious than the activities referred to in announcements to date.

Comprehensive Package of Investments Targets Urgent Challenges Facing Agriculture Today
Release & Contact Info
Email: press@usda.gov
WASHINGTON, September 29, 2021 – Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today announced a comprehensive set of investments to address challenges facing America’s agricultural producers. These include assistance to address challenges and costs associated with drought, animal health, market disruptions for agricultural commodities, and school food supply chain issues. Secretary Vilsack also outlined and requested public comments on a new climate partnership initiative designed to create new revenue streams for producers via market opportunities for commodities produced using climate-smart practices.
“American agriculture currently faces unprecedented challenges on multiple fronts,” said Vilsack. “The coronavirus pandemic has impacted every stage of our food supply chain, from commodity production through processing and delivery. Farmers, ranchers and forest landowners increasingly experience the impacts of climate change as severe storms, floods, drought and wildfire events damage their operations and impact their livelihoods. We know these challenges will continue into 2022, and others may emerge. Through this comprehensive set of investments, USDA will take action to prevent the spread of African Swine Fever, assist producers grappling with drought and market disruptions, and help school nutrition professionals obtain nutritious food for students. Tackling these challenges head-on better positions USDA to respond in the future as new challenges emerge.”
Comprehensive Investment Package – Details Announced Today
USDA is preparing $3 billion in investments that will support drought resilience and response, animal disease prevention, market disruption relief, and purchase of food for school nutrition programs. The support will be made available via the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). Specifically, funds will be used to provide:
$500 million to support drought recovery and encourage the adoption of water-smart management practices. From rising temperatures and heat waves, to early snow melt and low rainfall, record-breaking drought has affected producers across the country and has left ranchers with bare winter pastures and short on hay and pushed crop producers to adjust to running their operations with a fraction of the water usually available. This assistance will target these challenges and enable USDA’s Farm Production and Conservation agencies to deliver much needed relief and design drought resilience efforts responsive to the magnitude of this crisis.
Up to $500 million to prevent the spread of African Swine Fever (ASF) via robust expansion and coordination of monitoring, surveillance, prevention, quarantine, and eradication activities through USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. ASF outbreaks have proven devastating in other parts of the world due to lost production and trade. It is critical for all of us to work together to stop the spread of this disease.
$500 million to provide relief from agricultural market disruption, such as increased transportation challenges, availability and cost of certain materials, and other near-term obstacles related to the marketing and distribution of certain commodities, as part of Secretary Vilsack’s work as co-chair of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force.
Up to $1.5 billion to provide assistance to help schools respond to supply chain disruptions. Throughout the pandemic, school food professionals have met extraordinary challenges to ensure every child can get the food they need to learn, grow and thrive. But circumstances in local communities remain unpredictable, and supply chains for food and labor have been stressed and at times disrupted. These funds will support procurement of agricultural commodities and enable USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) and Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) to enhance the toolbox for school nutrition professionals working hard to make sure students have reliable access to healthy meals. Today’s announcement builds on the range of work that USDA has been doing to identify ongoing issues school districts face during this difficult time and provide the resources, tools and flexibility they need to serve students healthy and nutritious meals.
This set of targeted investments will address unmet needs in our food system, and complement a suite of programs USDA is implementing in response to COVID-19, including the Department’s Pandemic Assistance for Producers initiative and the longer-term Build Back Better initiative designed to address supply chain vulnerabilities and transform our food system based on lessons from COVID-19.
Climate-Smart Agriculture and Forestry Partnership Initiative: Request for Information
USDA is committed to partnering with agriculture, forestry and rural communities to develop climate solutions that strengthen rural America. Today, Secretary Vilsack announced a new initiative to finance the deployment of climate-smart farming and forestry practices to aid in the marketing of climate-smart agricultural commodities. Guided by science, USDA will support a set of pilot projects that provide incentives to implement climate smart conservation practices on working lands and to quantify and monitor the carbon and greenhouse gas benefits associated with those practices. The pilots could rely on the Commodity Credit Corporation’s specific power to aid in expansion or development of new and additional markets. The Department published a Request for Information (RFI) seeking public comment and input on design of new initiative.
“Through extreme weather, drought and fire, our agriculture producers are on the frontlines of climate change,” said Vilsack. “The new Climate-Smart Agriculture and Forestry Partnership Initiative will support pilots that create new market opportunities for commodities produced using climate-smart practices and position U.S. farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners as leaders in addressing climate change. The pilots will invest in the science, monitoring and verification to measure the benefits of these climate smart practices. Today, we ask for public input to inform our decision making and enhance the design of this initiative.”
Comments may be provided on or before 11:59 p.m. EST on November 1, 2021 via the Federal Register, Docket ID: USDA-2021-0010 . Feedback will be used to inform design of the new Climate-Smart Agriculture and Forestry Partnership Initiative. USDA is seeking input specifically on:
The current state of climate-smart commodity markets,
Systems for quantification,
Options and criteria for evaluation,
Use of information collected,
Options for review and verification,
Inclusion of historically underserved communities.
Comments are encouraged from farmers and farmer organizations, commodity groups, livestock producer groups, environmental organizations, agriculture businesses and technology companies, environmental market organizations, renewable energy organizations, Tribal organizations and governments, organizations representing historically underrepresented producers, organizations representing historically underrepresented communities and private corporations.
USDA is committed to equity in program delivery and explicitly seeks input on how to best serve historically underrepresented producers and communities. This aligns with the Justice40 initiative, an effort to ensure that Federal agencies work with states and local communities to deliver at least 40% of the overall benefits from Federal investments in climate and clean energy to disadvantaged communities.
Insights gained through this process will inform development of a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) soliciting Climate-Smart Agriculture and Forestry Partnership Initiative project proposals that encourage the adoption of climate-smart practices and promote markets for climate-smart commodities. USDA plans to announce the NOFA this fall, with project proposals accepted early next year.
Under the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA is engaged in a whole-of-government effort to combat the climate crisis. Through climate-smart agriculture and forestry partnerships, USDA aims to enhance and create new markets and streams of income for farmers, ranchers, producers and private foresters and strengthen rural economies while also improving protocols to measure, monitor and track carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions. Successfully meeting these challenges will require USDA to pursue a coordinated approach alongside stakeholders, including State, local and Tribal governments.
USDA touches the lives of all Americans each day in so many positive ways. In the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA is transforming America’s food system with a greater focus on more resilient local and regional food production, fairer markets for all producers, ensuring access to healthy and nutritious food in all communities, building new markets and streams of income for farmers and producers using climate smart food and forestry practices, making historic investments in infrastructure and clean energy capabilities in rural America, and committing to equity across the Department by removing systemic barriers and building a workforce more representative of America.

https://www.investopedia.com/eu-china-climate-deal-5192650,Massive New Climate Plans Unveiled by the EU and China,The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement adopted in 1997 that aimed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the presence of greenhouse.,15-Jul-2021,"Trends
The European Union (EU) and China announced sweeping plans this week to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to slow the pace of climate change. Many scientists say the warming climate is creating more hurricanes, floods, forest fires, and other events that threaten millions of people and the global economy. The EU and China represent two of the world's biggest economic areas and largest emitters of greenhouse gas. Their plans, announced July 14, have long been under discussion and are expected to take years before they are fully implemented. But they are considered by many policymakers to be important steps to fight climate change, although some environmentalists say the proposals don't go far enough.
The newly announced plans illustrate European and Chinese leaders' quest to be at the forefront of the fight against climate change just months before the next global climate change conference in Scotland in November. That progress contrasts starkly with the U.S., where President Biden's own ambitious climate plan faces stiff opposition, mostly from Republicans, in a divided Congress.
The EU's plan is dubbed the European Green Deal. It drastically limits the bloc's reliance on fossil fuels and imposes taxes on imports from countries that emit high levels of greenhouse gases. The EU accounted for 6.4% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2019, making it the world's fourth-largest emitter behind China, the U.S., and India. Its share of global GDP was 17.9% in 2020. The EU wants to achieve zero net emissions by 2050.
China's climate plan focuses on the launch of an emissions-trading system for Chinese companies, which would create the largest carbon market in the world and sharply increase the country's share of global emissions covered under similar types of programs. China, the world's largest emitter, accounted for 27% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2019. Its share of global GDP was 17.4% in 2020. China's plans will play a central role in helping it to achieve its previously stated aim of reaching net zero emissions by 2060.
Winners and losers
Both plans will have major impacts on global industries and the companies that operate within them. Fossil fuel companies are likely to be adversely affected, as are exporters from high-emitting industries or countries. Major producers of carbon will also be affected, such as the steel , cement, and power industries. However, alternative energy companies , such as wind , solar , and hydro, are likely to benefit from the new initiatives, as are companies that produce more energy-efficient products, such as electric cars. Plans that involve building renewable- and efficient-energy infrastructure would also benefit the construction industry.
Key Takeaways
The EU and China unveiled new plans in mid-July to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The EU aims to reduce emissions by 55% compared to 1990 levels and reach net zero emissions by 2050.
China's goal is to reach peak emissions by 2030 and net zero by 2060.
The EU's plan is named the European Green Deal and includes proposals to reduce emissions, increase renewable energy and energy efficiency, and restore the natural environment.
China's plan involves the launch of its carbon emissions trading scheme this month, which will allow companies to purchase allowances if they want to boost carbon emissions.
What Are the EU's and China's New Climate Initiatives?
European Green Deal
The European Green Deal is outlined by the European Commission (EC), the EU's politically independent executive branch. It is considered one of the most ambitious plans to date by any major economic power to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It outlines the bloc's targets for emissions, renewable and efficient energy, green building renovations, and nature restoration. It also outlines expected economic benefits and aims for international cooperation.
The EU wants to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. To get there, it is pledging to achieve its goal of reducing emissions by at least 55% by 2030, as mentioned above. The EU already had reduced its emissions by 24% from 1990 levels by 2019. The EU plan highlighted specific goals related to transportation, including zero emissions from all new cars by 2035. Beginning in 2026, the EU will cover road transport under an emissions trading scheme (ETS) , which is commonly referred to in the U.S. as a cap-and-trade program. The ETS will put a price on pollution and stimulate cleaner fuel use as well as investment in clean technologies. Carbon pricing for both the aviation and maritime sectors was also proposed.
The EU is also proposing a mechanism aimed at preventing polluting companies from shifting production outside the EU in order to circumvent the bloc's emission limits, then export back to the EU. The mechanism being proposed is a carbon tax imposed on imports from countries that have high greenhouse gas emissions. The tax would be the first of its kind.
The plan also would boost the bloc's sources of renewable energy and overall energy efficiency. The goal is for the EU's renewable sources of energy mix to reach 40% by 2030. Currently, renewables make up about 20% of the EU's total energy mix. The EU also wants to reduce its overall energy consumption by improving energy efficiency. Its target is to achieve a 36% overall reduction in energy consumption by 2030. One specific proposal is to require member EU states to increase their use of renewable energy in heating and cooling by +1.1 percentage points each year until 2030.
Other proposals include the creation of a new Social Climate Fund aimed at supporting the EU citizens who are most affected or at risk. The fund would be used to renovate buildings, provide income support, and bankroll other measures. The EU also wants to restore Europe's forests, soils, wetlands, and peatlands, which would help absorb CO2 and make the bloc more resilient to the effects of climate change. The EC says its new proposals could result in 35 million buildings renovated and 160,000 additional green jobs created in the construction sector by 2030.
China's national carbon market
China's long-awaited national carbon ETS is expected to launch sometime this month. China's ETS would become the world's largest carbon market by total volume. The intention is that the ETS will provide a market mechanism aimed at reducing emissions by enough so that total emissions peak by 2030 and the net zero target is reached by 2060.
The ETS is being set up on the new Shanghai Environment and Energy Exchange, which was scheduled to open on July 16, 2021. The exchange will allow thousands of companies to purchase additional emissions allowances from other, more energy-efficient firms. The trading system will set a price on emissions and provide companies with the ability to purchase allowances if they find themselves in a position in which they need to pollute more.
In seven trial markets for the ETS, the average carbon price was around 40 yuan ($6.18) per tonne, which is cheaper than the average carbon price of 47.25 euros ($55.67) per tonne, as expected on the EU's ETS from 2021 to 2025. Some firms have estimated that carbon prices may trade at around 40 yuan per tonne this year before rising to around 160 yuan in 2030.
The first phase of the plan will cover 2,225 companies in China's power generation sector. Those companies are responsible for more than 4 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions each year, approximately 40% of the national total and about 14% of global energy-related emissions. The ETS will expand to other high-emissions industries over the next three to five years, including petrochemicals, chemicals, building materials, iron and steel, nonferrous metals, paper, and domestic aviation.
The Bottom Line
What kind of impact the EU and China plans will have will depend on whether they will be implemented and how quickly. The EU proposals still need to be approved by its 27 member states and EU parliament, which could take years of negotiations. China, controlled by the Communist Party for decades, has the ability to implement its plan faster. China's ETS is expected to launch this month, but it still will take some time before its effectiveness is better understood.

This part of the report will present the latest scientific.,09-Aug-2021,"The second and third parts of the report, dealing with the expected impacts of climate change, and the actions required to prevent the worst impacts, are slated to come out next year.
The Assessment Reports
https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
The five previous assessment reports (see box) that have come out since the IPCC was established in 1988 have formed the basis of international climate change negotiations, and the actions that governments across the world have been taking in the last three decades to restrict the rise of global temperatures. Their value has been globally acknowledged, and the fourth assessment report, which came out in 2007, won the IPCC the Nobel Peace Prize.
Each of these voluminous reports, the last couple of them running into thousands of pages, have built upon the previous ones with updated knowledge and understanding of the climate system. All of them, starting from the first one in 1990, have been categorical in stating that the rise in global surface temperatures since the 1950s was most likely caused by human activities, and that any rise beyond 2°C, compared to the temperatures of the late 19th century, would make the Earth extremely difficult place to live for human beings, and thousands of other species of plants and animals.
The reports have also presented projections for temperature rise till 2100 under different scenarios and the kind of impacts that can be expected under each of these pathways.
Previous IPCC assessment reports: highlights
What will be new
Apart from incorporating the latest available scientific evidence, the Sixth Assessment Report is also attempting to provide more actionable information to help governments take policy decisions.
REGIONAL FOCUS: Thus far, the IPCC assessment reports have been presenting global scenarios. However, there are likely to be wide variations in the expected impacts of climate change from region to region, as acknowledged by the assessment reports themselves. The Sixth Assessment Report will put much more emphasis on regional assessment. So, it is expected that this report would likely state what the scenarios for sea-level rise in the Bay of Bengal region is, not just what the average sea-level rise across the world is likely to be.
EXTREME EVENTS: There is expected to be bigger focus on extreme weather events, like the ones we have seen in the last few weeks. Linking individual extreme events to climate change has always been debatable. But in the last few years, there has been significant advancement in attribution science, allowing scientists to say whether a particular event was a result of climate change. Attribution science is likely to get important space in the report.
CITIES: Densely populated mega-cities are supposed to be among the most vulnerable to impacts of climate change. The Sixth Assessment Report is expected to present specific scenarios the climate change impacts on cities and large urban populations, and also implications for key infrastructure. This is expected to be included only in the second part of the Sixth Assessment Report due next year.
SYNERGIES: IPCC is expected to present a more integrated understanding of the situation, cross-link evidence and discuss trade-offs between different options or pathways, and also likely to cover social implications of climate change action by countries.

Why it matters
The IPCC assessment reports have been extremely influential in directing the dialogue and action on climate change. The First Assessment Report led to the setting up of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the umbrella agreement under which international negotiations on climate change take place every year. The Second Assessment Report was the basis for the 1997 Kyoto Protocol that ran till last year, and the Fifth Assessment Report, which came out in 2014, guided the Paris Agreement.
The global climate architecture is now governed by the Paris Agreement, which replaced the Kyoto Protocol from this year. There have been enough indications to suggest that global action was far below what was needed to keep the temperatures below 2°C, as mandated under the Paris Agreement. In the immediate future, the IPCC report could serve as the most important warning towards the rapidly closing window of opportunity to halt the rise in temperatures to unacceptable levels, and propel the governments to take more urgent actions.

GLASGOW, Nov 12 (Reuters) - When all is said and done at the U.N. climate talks, and the ink on the COP26 agreement is dry, one awkward question will remain: how enforceable will the deal be anyway?
In the last year, countries have announced a flurry of net-zero emissions pledges. The United States promised net zero by 2050, China and Saudi Arabia targeted 2060, and India 2070. Many other countries submitted formal pledges - known as ""nationally determined contributions"" or NDCs - to cut emissions this decade, ahead of this month's U.N. climate conference in Glasgow.
Whether those goals are legally binding is for individual countries to decide.

The 2015 Paris Agreement, a legally binding international treaty, commits its nearly 200 signatory countries only to hold global warming to "" well below "" 2 degrees Celsius and aim for 1.5C. But the accord left it up to countries to set their own national contributions towards the overall Paris targets, and doesn't require they meet them.
""The NDCs are voluntary measures,"" said Lakshman Guruswamy, an international environmental law expert at the University of Colorado-Boulder. ""There's no way of implementing, imposing, or trying to enforce a non-binding agreement.""
Countries including Britain and New Zealand, and the 27-country EU, have fixed individual emission-cutting targets into their own laws. Most nations have not.
International treaties tend not to threaten penalties and instead rely on other political strategies and pressure tactics to ensure cooperation.
But some experts say they should mandate legally binding emissions cuts, given that decades of U.N. climate summits and voluntary pledges have so far failed to halt the rise in emissions and global temperatures.
""I don't think we're going to have significant progress unless there are legally binding emissions restrictions that are placed on developing countries and developed countries,"" Guruswamy said.
Only once has a U.N. climate treaty set binding targets for individual countries. The 1992 Kyoto Protocol applied them to richer nations only and involved a complex process of national ratifications that meant it didn't fully enter into force until 2005.
Making targets binding can also backfire .
When confronted with the final Kyoto agreement, U.S. politicians balked and the country never ratified it. Canada withdrew from the pact in 2011, before its penalty regime took effect.
If the Paris Agreement had included stronger rules, ""countries would have stayed out,"" said Ronald Mitchell, a professor of political science and environmental studies at the University of Oregon.
""Being overly ambitious can reduce participation, there's no question. Politics is the art of the possible.""
'PEER PRESSURE'
While there is no clear mechanism for enforcing a ""legally binding"" pact under international environmental law, U.N. climate agreements still have ways of keeping signatories in check, experts say.
Backing out of a global deal, or even failing to meet commitments, can be a mark of shame on the international stage. Countries that violate an agreement also risk retaliation in other spheres, such as finance or trade.
The Paris deal includes some systems to push countries toward meeting their pledges and increasing them, including a five-year ""global stock-take"" of progress.
These systems can show which countries are lagging behind, creating a ""peer-pressure environment"", said Leslie-Anne Duvic-Paoli, deputy director of the Climate Law and Governance Centre at King's College London.
LEGAL PRECEDENCE
International climate pacts can also be included in other binding deals or bilateral agreements.
The European Union and Japan's 2017 trade deal, for example, referenced their Paris Agreement commitments.
The EU now demands similar language in all its new trade accords, and from 2024 it will be able to withdraw preferential trade access for developing countries if they don't meet environmental conventions, including the Paris accord.
Climate pacts can also be used in court. The U.N. Environment Programme in January described a ""growing tidal wave of climate cases"", with climate lawsuits being brought in 38 countries in 2020, up from 24 in 2017.
In a landmark 2019 legal case, activists successfully sued the Dutch government for failing to protect people from global warming, and pointed to the country's Paris Agreement obligations in their legal arguments. The court ordered the government to slash emissions faster.
""We've seen a number of decisions in courts and jurisdictions all around the world that have read the Paris Agreement to set legally enforceable targets,"" said Michael Burger, executive director of Columbia University's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.
Ultimately, states need to have the political will to see their pledges through, he said.
""There is no international or supranational body that is going to come in and make the governments of the world do something they're not willing to do.""

Clean energy: In what could be a new paradigm for helping.",1 month ago,"What's the climate impact of COP26 private jets?
""The mood of the conference is good,"" Pete Betts, the former EU lead negotiator on climate change told me.
""The trend towards a zero-carbon world is irreversible. The question is when we get there, and what the climate will be like by then.""
His relative optimism can be explained by some of announcements made at the summit so far:
Money: Rich nations have clumsily failed to deliver their promised $100bn to poor countries by 2020. But the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney is looking to move trillions of dollars of private capital towards supporting clean technology . He has gathered 450 organisations controlling 130 trillion dollars, or around 40% of global private assets, and they plan to shift finances to activities that help the move towards zero carbon, such as renewable energy. Critics complain the financial institutions will be allowed to invest in fossil fuels, but it's a serious and novel offer
Trees: More than 100 countries promised to reverse deforestation by 2030 . The pledge includes almost Â£14bn ($19.2bn) of public and private funds. We've seen similar initiatives before, but this one's better funded
Methane: There's a pact to cut emissions of the world's second-worst warming gas, methane, by 30% by 2030 . Big emitters China, Russia and India haven't signed, but it's hoped they will join later
Creating markets: Forty nations led by the UK and including China, India and the US, will impose standards, incentives and rules, to create markets for new technologies. This could be transformative if it works. The partners might, for instance, agree a date by which a certain percentage of steel is made without using coal. This would give investors the confidence to know that markets for innovative technologies would be available, and could radically lower the price of clean tech worldwide
Clean energy: In what could be a new paradigm for helping countries to transition to clean energy, South Africa will get Â£6bn ($8.5 billion) to ditch coal , in a deal with France, Germany, the UK, the US and the EU
India: Prime Minister Modi has set aggressive targets for low-carbon power by 2030 . Some people are worried that he doesn't plan to end greenhouse gases until 2070 - but the world will have changed completely by then, and India is likely to be forced economically come into step
UK rules: Most big UK firms and financial institutions will be asked to show how they intend to hit climate change targets . Plans will be submitted to an expert panel to ensure they are not just spin
Kat Kramer from Christian Aid, which campaigns on climate change, says the many announcements are a positive sign.
""The COP itself is a consensus process, so it's a lowest common denominator. What we're seeing is other initiatives bolted on to the COP - there's real momentum.""

So far so good, then. But there have been disappointments.
It had been expected that China would improve its offer to peak emissions by 2030. At least a token gesture was anticipated, but it's brought nothing.
The only consolation for the COP is that China usually over-delivers on its promises - unlike some others.
Take the US. Former President George W Bush withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol and Donald Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement.
The election of a Republican governor in Virginia yesterday raises the spectre of Mr Trump's possible return, which would probably undo climate measures all over again.
Negotiators will now get down to the messy task of sorting out a rule book, so that nations can trust each other's carbon-cutting plans.
They'll be rowing about the lack of government finance for poor countries, and the need for more money to adapt to global heating. And they want ""loss and damage"" - code for compensation for harm done to them by the emissions of poor nations.
The Virginia news won't help trust - but there's a feeling that by the standards of many COPs, this has got off to a good start.

Kigali Amendment — global pact just ratified by India targets greenhouse gases used in your AC
Part of Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, the Kigali Amendment, 2016, seeks to phase out hydrofluorocarbons.

New Delhi: On 27 September, India officially ratified the Kigali Amendment of the Montreal Protocol, joining 125 other countries in the fight to phase out hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) — harmful greenhouse gases used in refrigeration and air-conditioning that are known to accelerate global warming.
This key amendment is part of the larger ‘Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer’ framework, or the Montreal Protocol, which is a global pact seeking to regulate the production and consumption of nearly 100 manmade ozone-depleting substances. All United Nations (UN) members are parties to the pact.
Ozone-depleting substances are considered harmful for the Earth’s ozone layer — a thin layer in the stratosphere containing ozone molecules, which absorb cancer-causing ultraviolet rays from the Sun.
HFCs don’t deplete the ozone layer, but they have a high global warming potential (GWP) of 12 to 14,000. Global warming potential is a value assigned to represent the amount of heat trapped by it, relative to the amount of heat trapped by a similar mass of carbon dioxide. The GWP of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas due to human emissions, is 1.
According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), overall HFC emissions are growing at a rate of 8 per cent per year and the annual emissions are projected to rise to 7-19 per cent of global CO2 emissions by 2050.

The Vienna Convention — where it all began
The Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer was held the same year a major, worrying discovery about a ‘hole’ in the ozone layer over the Antarctic was discovered, in 1985.
Ozone is a molecule made up of three oxygen atoms and can be destroyed when it comes into contact with bromine or chlorine. Some of the compounds that release chlorine include chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) — two potent ozone-depleting substances that were commonly used in refrigerators, air conditioners, foaming and cleaning agents, car dashboards, and the soles of shoes, among hundreds of other things.
The Convention was the first international agreement dedicated to protecting the ozone layer. All countries were required to cooperate in research and exchange information about the ozone layer, and adopt “appropriate measures” to protect it.
But the agreement made no enforceable rules, neither did it enact any control measures. According to UN archives , “During the Vienna Convention negotiations, countries discussed a possible protocol that would provide specific targets for certain chemicals, but no consensus was reached.”
A working group under the UNEP began negotiations on a protocol, out of which the Montreal Protocol was formed in 1987.

The Montreal Protocol
Unlike the Vienna Convention, the Montreal Protocol lays down legally binding and measurable agreements with specific timelines for high-income and low-income countries to follow. It mandated the complete phase-out of CFCs and HCFCs, for example, and made provisions for control measures, monitoring of trade, and annual reporting of data on ozone-depleting substances.
Thirty years after it first came into effect, the Montreal Protocol succeeded in phasing out 99 per cent of harmful ozone-depleting substances, and the hole in the ozone layer is likely to go back to pre-1980 levels by 2070 . According to the UN, without the Protocol, the hole over the Antarctic would have been about 40 per cent larger in size by 2013.
It has also led to the prevention of an estimated 2 million cases of skin cancer each year by 2030.
The Meeting of the Parties — the governance body of the Montreal Protocol — happens every year, and the Protocol continues to be adjusted and amended to meet its goals.
The Kigali Amendment, signed in 2016, is the latest.

The Kigali Amendment
The Montreal Protocol was never meant to be a tool to combat climate change, but it has become one with the Kigali Amendment, which was signed in October 2016 at the Rwandan capital.
The phase-down of HFCs under the amendment is expected to prevent the emission of up to 105 million tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2100, which in turn will help avoid an up to 0.5 degree rise in global temperatures above pre-industrial levels.
Like the Montreal Protocol, targets in the Kigali Agreement have been staggered for high- and low-income countries. Countries like the US must meet this target by 2036, while India has until 2047 and China until 2045. India was one of the last, major countries to officially ratify the amendment.
The Kigali Amendment’s contribution to curbing global warming is especially significant in light of another crucial climate treaty, the Paris Agreement.
Signed in 2015, the Paris Agreement is a legally binding policy that requires countries to cut emissions of greenhouse gases in order to slow global warming. The agreement aims to keep global temperatures “well below” a set threshold — 2°C above pre-industrial levels — to prevent extreme weather events and climate change.

The main objective of the plan is to create a comprehensive strategy to tackle the challenges of climate change in the city.
With Mumbai being one of the high risk cities to the worst impacts of climate change, Cabinet Minister of Environment, Tourism and Protocol, Aaditya Thackeray, launched the first ever Climate Action Plan dedicated to the city, today. The programme aims to ensure better future planning and growth of the city while keeping in tune with climate adaptation, mitigation and resilience.
Transport sector responsible for 24 percent of overall green house gas emissions
Website launched to get inputs from experts and citizens for the plan
Plan will focus on six action tracks
Transport and Energy sector responsible for highest emissions in Mumbai
Currently, the total carbon emissions for Mumbai is 34.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent. This is as per the emissions data analysed between 2010 and 2020 from sectors including transport, waste, energy and others collected from Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), State agencies as well as private companies.
It is further estimated that every person in Mumbai is currently contributing 2.67 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (based on 2019 estimates). Similarly, India’s approximate average contribution per person is estimated to be 1.91 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.
The results showed that the energy sector contributes the highest emissions, at 71 percent of the overall green house gas (GHG) emissions. The transport sector contributes to 24 percent, and the solid waste sector contributes to 5 percent. “Due to high domestic usage of electricity, and 95 percent of Mumbai’s electricity is coal based, the energy sector is the highest emitter,” said Lubaina Rangwala, Associate Director, WRI India Ross Center for Sustainable Cities.
The Transport sector meanwhile, has made moves in a bid to reduce its contribution to the emissions. In July 2021, Maharashtra announced a new Electric Vehicles (EV) Policy , incentivising the purchase of these alternate fuel vehicles. On August 17, the city got its first public EV charging station at the Kohinoor Square Building, MCGM car park in Dadar. In addition, the policy anticipates the installation of 1,500 charging stations across the Mumbai region. By 2025, the state hopes to have 10 percent of all vehicles registered in the state to be EVs.
Furthermore, Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) has confirmed that it will solely be purchasing or leasing electric buses from now on. By the end of 2022, BEST expects 45 percent of its fleet to be electric. To decrease air pollution, BEST has also planned to convert all 250 diesel buses it has to compressed natural gas (CNG).
Climate Action Plan for Mumbai: details
As part of the C40 Cities Network, which Mumbai joined in December 2020, the city is encouraged to draft its Climate Action Plan by the end of 2021 and is doing so in compliance with C40 guidelines and ambitious standards. The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai is developing the climate action plan with technical support from knowledge partner World Resources Institute India.
Thackeray also launched the Mumbai Climate Action Plan (MCAP) website to seek suggestions and inputs from experts and citizens from the city. Citizens will be able to submit their recommendations until September 20, 2021. The process of finalising action tracks under MCAP is expected to be done and ready by November 2021 closer to the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26).
Speaking at the event, Aaditya Thackeray said the time for action is now as any further delays would make Mumbai unsuitable to live in over the next decade. “Mainstreaming climate action while implementing Mumbai’s development plan can protect the city’s natural systems, increase resilience capacities of vulnerable groups, and enable resilient urban growth that ensures aggressive reductions to the city’s greenhouse gas emissions,” he said.
According to Thackeray, the main objective of the plan is to create a comprehensive strategy to tackle challenges of climate change in the city of Mumbai by adopting inclusive and robust mitigation and adaptation strategies.
The six action tracks of the Climate Action Plan
The plan will focus on six action tracks to introduce sector specific strategies for mitigation and adaptation that can lead to implementable climate projects that contribute to the city’s resilience. The six thematic action areas are sustainable waste management, urban greening and biodiversity, urban flooding and water resource management, building energy efficiency, air quality and sustainable mobility.
I S Chahal, Municipal Commissioner stated, “There is a need for changing the way we think about development in the current climate change scenario. Coordinated efforts for data monitoring and management, will help us make quick and informed decisions, ensuring the safety of those most vulnerable in our city – Mumbai’s approach during the pandemic has been exactly this.”

The United Nations is poised to release the most confident and comprehensive assessment yet of global warming, including detailed estimates of how continued greenhouse-gas emissions will increase Earth’s sea levels and drive extreme weather in the coming years. Compiled by more than 200 scientists and approved by government representatives from 195 countries, the report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will leave little doubt that humans are altering the way the planet functions — and that things will get much worse if governments do not take drastic action, say climate researchers interviewed by Nature.
Many hope that the report, which covers the latest advances in climate science, will galvanize action at the UN climate summit in Glasgow, UK, this November, where world leaders will make fresh commitments to curbing greenhouse-gas emissions. Scientists say that on the basis of current policies, governments will fail to meet the goals they set in the 2015 Paris climate accord to limit global warming to 1.5–2 °C above pre-industrial levels.
The hard truths of climate change — by the numbers
“This report will make it absolutely clear what is the state of the science, and throw the ball back in the camp of the governments for action,” says Corinne Le Quéré, a climate scientist at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK.
It is the first in a trio of reports that will comprise the IPCC’s sixth major climate assessment since 1990: a second report, on climate impacts and adaptation, and a third, on mitigation efforts, will follow next year. In anticipation of the first report’s release next week, Nature previews what researchers say are some of the most significant advances in climate science conducted since the last IPCC assessment eight years ago.
High confidence, hot models
After several decades of research, climate scientists have no doubt that greenhouse-gas emissions cause global temperatures to rise. Concentrations of these gases have risen by around 50% since pre-industrial times, and the planet has warmed by more than 1 °C (see ‘Warmer worlds’). By some estimates, the world is on track for nearly 3 °C of warming unless governments do more to curb these emissions.
Researchers have grown more confident in such projections as climate science has advanced — a point that the IPCC report will emphasize. One way in which scientists have assessed their climate projections is through a metric known as climate sensitivity. This is a measure of the projected long-term warming that would occur if the planet’s atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels doubled compared with pre-industrial levels. Despite advances in understanding and computing power, estimates of climate sensitivity have been stuck at around 1.5–4.5 °C since the 1970s. Recent efforts to narrow that range have significantly boosted scientists’ trust in projections of how quickly the world might warm in the coming decades.

In a study published in July 2020 1 , for instance, a team of researchers challenged climate models with multiple lines of evidence, including contemporary climate records and evidence from ancient climates. They determined a likely climate sensitivity of 2.6–3.9 °C.
“It sounds a little esoteric, but it would actually be a pretty big deal if the IPCC narrows the range of climate sensitivity,” says Zeke Hausfather, a co-author of the study and a climate scientist at the Breakthrough Institute in Oakland, California. Narrowing the range would help to constrain models and improve future projections.
But Hausfather is quick to note that many of the latest climate models — including those from large modelling centres in the United States and the United Kingdom — are projecting warming that is well above even the previous climate sensitivity estimates. About one-third of the roughly 40 models that have run climate-sensitivity tests predict more than 4.5 °C of warming if CO2 levels double, puzzling scientists who consider such extreme levels of warming to be implausible given other lines of evidence.
IPCC says limiting global warming to 1.5 °C will require drastic action
Scientists are still working out precisely why the models are running hot, but some research suggests that part of the answer could be the use of sophisticated new representations of cloud microphysics and tiny particles in the atmosphere called aerosols. For example, earlier models featured unrealistic clouds consisting of too much ice, which would turn to water as the globe warmed. This produced a cooling effect because water-based clouds reflect more solar energy back into space. The latest models start out with more-realistic clouds that have more water, which reduces the cooling effect over time.
But that’s just one piece of a larger equation that climate scientists are still working out, says Gavin Schmidt, who heads the modelling team at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City. Some models that run hot might need to be weighted less when calculating metrics such as climate sensitivity, says Schmidt. But they could still provide useful predictions for climate variables such as precipitation patterns, he adds.
As it interprets the latest climate projections, the IPCC should recognize that scientists are only beginning to delve into these questions, says Schmidt.
Rising tides
The world got a sneak preview of how Earth’s sea levels might rise when the IPCC released a special report in 2019 . The science that it presented, which will undoubtedly be included in next week’s release, experts say, pointed to average global sea levels rising by between 0.3 metres and 1.1 metres by 2100, depending on greenhouse-gas emissions. That is only slightly higher than previous projections, but the report also cited recent studies analysing the opinions of experts in the field, who declared that a 2-metre rise cannot be ruled out. Such an extreme change could displace tens of millions of people from their homes in low-lying regions.
Pinning down sea-level rise is difficult because it depends on complex questions about whether ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica will collapse — and, if so, how fast. Scientists have made notable progress, however, in understanding how rising tides could affect communities on a local and regional, rather than just a global, scale since the last major IPCC climate assessment in 2013. This is important because different cities, countries and regions will experience sea-level rise in very different ways, says Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University in New Jersey who was an author of the special IPCC report.
US urged to invest in sun-dimming studies as climate warms
For instance, the ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica are so large that they exert a gravitational effect that causes the oceans to swell around them. When some of the ice melts, the local swelling subsides and the water redistributes elsewhere, such as to the northeastern United States — leading to rising sea levels there.
“It’s the first time the IPCC has done a comprehensive analysis of all of these local and regional effects,” Oppenheimer says. The information is important, he says, because even seemingly small increases in local sea levels can have significant impacts — particularly on flooding during storms. In many areas around the world, Oppenheimer adds, once-in-a-century floods will become annual events by the end of the century, even under the most optimistic climate scenarios.
The attribution of extremes
Next week’s IPCC report comes on the heels of epic flooding in Germany, in July, and a June heatwave that baked the US Pacific Northwest and western Canada, where the town of Lytton recorded a record temperature of 49.6 °C before a wildfire nearly razed it to the ground. Shortly afterwards, climate scientists assessed the heatwave and concluded that global warming was almost certainly a driver, and had increased the likelihood of such an event by a factor of 150 since the end of the nineteenth century.

As little as a decade ago, scientists tended to demur when asked about the link between global warming and any single extreme climate event, except to say that we should expect more of them as the climate warms. But the science of climate attribution has advanced considerably in recent years, says Sonia Seneviratne, a climate scientist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. So, even though the recent heatwave analysis won’t be included in the new IPCC report because it wasn’t published in time, a substantial body of research on extreme weather exists for the IPCC to assess, says Seneviratne.
Two things have happened to drive this change. The first is that climate scientists have developed improved models and statistical methods for determining the likelihood that any given climate event could occur, either with or without human-induced climate change. But just as important, Seneviratne says, climate change itself is advancing, and recent studies show that increasingly extreme weather events are now emerging above the noise of natural variability.
Or, in the words of Le Quéré, we can now see the impacts of global warming “with our own eyes”.

International.,20-Jun-2021,"Biden brings new momentum to global climate change agenda
20 June 2021
Author: Robert C Stowe, Harvard University
US President Joe Biden is serious about addressing climate change. He re-joined the Paris Agreement on the first day of his presidency, adopted a ‘ whole of government ’ approach to addressing climate change, put forward a number of executive initiatives and revived others to reduce emissions, and has placed climate change near the centre of sweeping proposed infrastructure legislation — the American Jobs Plan .
As promised during his election campaign, Biden also convened a virtual Leaders Summit on Climate on 22 and 23 April, during which he announced an ambitious new US emissions reduction pledge under the Paris Agreement.
Is the United States back as a global leader on climate change?
Despite Biden’s efforts, the Trump administration’s aversion to international cooperation and its climate denial are still fresh in the minds of other global leaders. They also remember former US president George W Bush rejecting the Kyoto Protocol after the Clinton administration signed it. International leaders know full well that US zigzagging on climate policy arises from domestic politics — and they see familiar danger signs in Washington.
President Biden holds only razor-thin majorities in Congress, putting legislation that will be required to achieve much of his ambitious climate agenda out of reach. The President’s green infrastructure plan is already in trouble in Congress. Biden may lose even this slim congressional majority in the 2022 mid-term elections, and potentially the presidency itself in 2024 to a Trump-like Republican, putting the executive action he will have been able to undertake at great risk.
As the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on 16 April, in response to US exhortations to do more on climate: ‘ The return of the United States is not as a king returning, at all, but as a truant student getting back to class’. China, India and other countries with significant emissions will continue to address climate change based on their own analysis and perceptions of the problem and their own domestic political imperatives, not based on what they see as fickle and illusory US leadership .
Yet, the United States managed to convene 40 heads of state and government at the Leaders Summit on Climate. These leaders may have tacitly acknowledged that, despite grave misgivings about the continuity of US climate leadership, a Biden administration governing the world’s second largest-emitting country is an improvement on four more years of Trump. Even if the Biden administration only has two to four years in office, they may have thought it best to back him, given that climate change is an emergency and the coming years are crucial in bending the emissions curve downward.
One major objective of the summit was to provide a forum for major-emitting countries to submit more ambitious pledges under the Paris Agreement. A number of leaders announced new commitments, including the leaders of South Korea and Japan. China and India, the world’s first- and fourth-largest emitters, did not.
But just before the summit, China did promise to observe an important international agreement to reduce emissions of potent greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide. India and the United States agreed to finance and accelerate deployment of clean energy technology. Participants announced numerous other agreements or actions , including longer-term, ‘net-zero’ commitments. It is impossible to determine how many of these would have been announced without Biden’s summit, but certainly not all and certainly not in such dramatic fashion.
Also in connection with the summit, the United States revived two important institutional frameworks for addressing climate change. First, the summit served to reconvene the US-led Major Economies Forum (MEF) on Energy and Climate, whose members are the 17 largest-emitting countries in the world and which had lain dormant during the Trump administration. Under the Bush and Obama administrations, MEF meetings provided a valuable opportunity for informal communication among large-emitting countries and helped catalyse convergence in negotiating positions ahead of the annual UN climate-change conferences.
Second, US–China bilateral cooperation on climate was revived in advance of the summit (Chinese diplomatic snark notwithstanding). Bilateral agreements in 2015 were crucial factors in the success of the Paris Agreement. International leaders watching John Kerry (then US Secretary of State, now US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate) and Xie Zhenhua (then China’s chief climate negotiator, now China’s Special Envoy for Climate Change) back at the table were surely heartened — and perhaps encouraged to ‘unmute’ on Zoom.
President Biden continued to provide some degree of leadership at the G7 summit on 11–13 June, including a strong statement on climate in its communique . At least he did not stand in the way. The G20 summit in Rome in October may be expected to benefit from the Leaders Summit as well — its 20 members include all members of the MEF.
We will then approach this year’s UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties in Glasgow in November with some momentum, thanks in part to the modest success of the Leaders Summit on Climate in precipitating more ambitious action and re-forming institutions for addressing climate change. Perhaps US leadership is back after all — at least for this year, and at least in Glasgow. And perhaps that’s enough for now.

Published Oct. 5, 2021Updated Nov. 13, 2021
In a few weeks, an estimated 20,000 ministers, activists and executives from nearly every country in the world are set to descend on Glasgow to hammer out how to make progress on climate change .
And yet, the Marshall Islands chief negotiator still doesn’t know how many people from her country are coming with her. An activist from Kenya has no idea when, or if, he will get vaccinated against Covid-19, while another from Mexico has flown to the United States to get a dose. And the British government hosts are still trying to figure out how to get Scotland’s health labs ready to process coronavirus tests in case of an outbreak.
The climate summit, known as the 26th session of the Conference of Parties, or COP26 , will be one of the biggest international gatherings held during the Covid-19 pandemic when it starts Oct. 31. Among those expected to attend are Queen Elizabeth, Pope Francis and at least 100 presidents and prime ministers, including President Biden of the United States.
The stakes are exceptionally high.
The biggest polluting countries in the world are under the spotlight to show whether they can do what is necessary to stave off the worst effects of climate change. Coronavirus cases continue to soar. And many of the summit participants will be coming from countries where vaccines are still not widely available, particularly in the global south. Globally, fewer than half of all adults have been vaccinated against Covid-19 , illustrating the inequities of vaccination.
“Organizing a COP is a huge, huge challenge anyway,” said Alok Sharma, a veteran British politician in charge of this conference, in a recent interview in Washington, D.C. “Organizing a COP in Covid, the challenge has been magnified.”
Despite some calls to hold the conference virtually or postpone it — as last year’s gathering was — Mr. Sharma has been adamant that leaders need to gather in person to address the climate crisis. He pledged that Britain will try to run the mass gathering in a way that minimizes the likelihood of infections. But there are still risks.
Conference organizers have said vaccinations are encouraged but the United Nations, under whose auspices the annual climate negotiations are held, does not require them at its meetings. There’s also no way to verify whether vaccine certificates are legitimate. Britain has offered free vaccines to anyone who wants them, though many say they have yet to receive them.

Alex Saier, the spokesman for the United Nations climate agency, said by email that his office worked with the British government and the World Health Organization to develop health protocols.
“The collective decision was to strongly encourage all participants to be vaccinated before coming to the COP for the health and safety of all, but to not make it mandatory since some participants have medical or other issues that preclude them from vaccinations,” Mr. Saier said.
In any case, presidents and prime ministers can’t be required to quarantine, because of diplomatic immunity provisions. And so Mr. Sharma’s team is counting on good behavior.
Delegates will have to sign a code of conduct, stipulating that they will follow public health protocols, including daily coronavirus testing to enter the main venue and wearing masks while walking the hallways. Negotiators who normally huddle for hours in windowless rooms, debating commas and verbs in official documents, will also be encouraged to keep their masks on.
Leaders from environmental groups and other nongovernment organizations who typically monitor the negotiations will have limited access to rooms where those sessions are held. Every nation is being told to trim the size of its delegation.
“We want to ensure a safe event,” Mr. Sharma said.
About 1,000 people have requested vaccines and Mr. Sharma said “several hundred” have been vaccinated through the British government’s program, though his office would not say precisely how many. Britain is encouraging delegates to receive vaccines administered by their own national programs but that hasn’t been possible for some attendees.
Consider the case of Nobert Nyandire of Kenya. When Britain offered vaccinations, he applied.
That was in July. He is still waiting.
Mr. Nyandire is with the East Africa chapter of Climate Action Network, which represents more than 1,000 nongovernmental organizations.
The United Nations told him in early September that vaccinations, provided by Britain, would begin soon in his country. Three weeks later, the United Nations suggested that he rely on Kenya’s national vaccination program. He says that communications have been confusing and that he still hopes to get the vaccine, though there is no guarantee.
A fellow activist in Mexico, Maria Reyes, worried that the vaccine offer from Britain wouldn’t come in time. She flew to Los Angeles, got a Johnson & Johnson dose at the airport, and flew home the same day, woozy from the side effects.
“It was honestly horrible,” Ms. Reyes, who is a member of the Fridays for the Future movement said. Like Mr. Nyandire, she had been told to get vaccinated through her country’s national program. But Ms. Reyes is 19 years old, and in her small town of Coronango, in central Mexico, there was a limited supply of vaccines available only to older people.

Asked for a response to the confusion, United Nations officials noted that Britain is running the vaccination program and referred questions to the British organizers.

Card 1 of 5
Tighter auto pollution rules. The Environmental Protection Agency announced on Dec. 20 strengthened limits on pollution from automobile tailpipes , in a bid to reduce a major source of the carbon dioxide emissions that are heating the planet.
A week of wild weather. Violent storms  swept across the central and southern United States in mid-December, killing dozens  and leaving a trail of destruction. One key question is what role global warming might have played  in fueling such extreme weather events.
Sounding the alarm. A report on the state of the Arctic highlights troubling and consistent trends  in the region that are linked to global warming. Researchers are also growing increasingly concerned about Antarctica , where ice shelves are melting and wilder winds are altering crucial currents.
Google and climate denial. Google announced in October that it would stop placing ads on sites that deny the scientific consensus on climate change. But a new analysis shows that Google’s policy, which was to go into effect on Nov. 9, has had limited effect so far .
The race for green energy. Bolivia’s lithium deposits could one day power tens of millions of electric vehicles. One small Texas energy start-up set out to compete with Chinese and Russian industrial giants  in unlocking the country’s mineral riches.
“I am confident everyone who has asked to get vaccinated will get vaccinated,” Mr. Sharma insisted.
Whether or not delegates are vaccinated, those coming from countries that Britain has placed on its “red list” because of high infection rates must quarantine upon arrival. Those who are vaccinated like Ms. Reyes must quarantine for five days, while unvaccinated travelers must isolate for 10 days.
Under pressure from civil society groups, which argued the cost of quarantine was prohibitive and that the conference should be delayed, Britain has said it will pay for quarantine hotels.
Meanwhile, everyone attending the conference will be expected to show a negative result each day from a self-administered rapid coronavirus test.
For 20,000 delegates over 14 days, that’s potentially 280,000 rapid test kits to be distributed to hotels and private apartments housing delegates. Anyone who tests positive will be asked to immediately isolate and take a P.C.R. test, which must be processed by a laboratory. Results can take more than 24 hours, if laboratory capacity is available.
But delegates need to reach Scotland first.
Tina Stege, the chief negotiator of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, a country whose very existence is threatened by rising sea levels, is trying to navigate air travel in the Covid era.
Flights out of the Marshall Islands are more infrequent because of the pandemic, and getting to Scotland requires navigating the quarantine regulations of various countries in transit. Once delegates return, they also will be subject to the Marshall Islands’ strict two week quarantine for international travelers.

All Ms. Stege said she knows for sure is that her country’s delegation will be smaller than years past.
“It’s really crazy to tell you that at this time, with just 30 days, we are still trying to work it out and figure out exactly how we’re going to make it work,” Ms. Stege said. “We’ve gone through plan A, B and C.”
There’s another brewing uncertainty: While Glasgow’s public transportation, pubs and hotels require patrons to wear masks, there are exceptions, like when eating, drinking and dancing. Unlike during the Tokyo Olympics, where athletes stayed inside the protective bubble of the Olympic Village, those attending COP26 will be scattered throughout Glasgow.
Inevitably, the question has come up: Is it necessary to have tens of thousands of people gather in person in order to slow down climate change?
Earlier this year, the government of Sweden commissioned a study that looked at whether technology might permit future U.N. climate summits to be held online.
“This is not going to go away with Covid,” said Richard J.T. Klein, a senior research fellow at the Stockholm Environment Institute who led the study. “Even if we all can meet again in person, I think a question that we should ask ourselves is, ‘Do we want to meet again with 30,000 people in one place?’”

story highlights
COP 15 will now take place in two parts: a virtual format from 11-15 October 2021, and an in-person event from 25 April-8 May 2022.
Among the agenda items for COP 15 is the conclusion of negotiations on a post-2020 global biodiversity framework.
The Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has announced a revised schedule for the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15), the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CP-MOP 10), and the fourth meeting of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization (NP-MOP 4). COP 15 is expected to provide for the conclusion of negotiations on a post-2020 global biodiversity framework.
COP 15 was originally expected to convene in October 2020 in Kunming, China. Due to the global pandemic emerging in early 2020, the meetings were rescheduled several times. On 18 August 2021, the Secretariat announced that COP 15 will not take place in person in October 2021. Instead, COP 15 will take place in two parts.
The first part will take place in a virtual format, from 11-15 October 2021. Accredited delegates from embassies and organizations already located and based in China may gather in Kunming during this period. The second part of COP 15 will be a face-to-face meeting in Kunming, China, from 25 April-8 May 2022.
The October 2021 event will include an opening of the meetings, discussion of agenda items that must be addressed for the continuation of the operations of the Convention and the Protocols, and a high-level segment. China, in consultation with the Secretariat, will convene the virtual high-level segment from 12-13 October 2021, with the objective of providing political momentum for the preparations of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. 
The in-person event in 2022 will address the remaining agenda items of the Meetings, including the finalization and adoption of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. A high-level segment is expected to take place during this event as well. 
Several meetings announced in the CBD’s revised schedule will provide for in-person preparatory negotiations on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework and other substantive matters. These meetings are: the resumed session of SBSTTA 24; the resumed session of SBI 3; and the Open-Ended Working Group on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. These are tentatively expected to convene in person in Geneva, Switzerland, in January 2022. 
SBSTTA 24 and SBI 3 held on-line meetings in May-June 2021. An online session of the Open-ended Working Group on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework will take place from 23 August-3 September 2021. 
Registration for the first part of COP 15 is open until 1 October 2021. [ CBD Announcement ]

COP26: With Developed World Not Doing Its Bit, India’s Case for Climate Justice is Strong
India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been pro-active internally and externally on the climate change front, writes Kanwal Sibal. (Image: MEA/Twitter)
As in the past, developed countries seek to push for a solution that is in their favour. They have stronger economies, smaller populations and more advanced technology.

Climate change discussions are complex and contentious. While it is the shared interest of humanity to prevent global warming, the inequities at the root of the issue of global warming cannot be easily wished away. The concept of common but differentiated responsibilities as between the developed and developing countries with regard to climate change has been steadily diluted, as has been that of per capita emissions.
This disadvantages developing countries and India, in particular, because of their huge population, low levels of energy consumption and increased energy consumption required for poverty alleviation and economic growth. Nevertheless, India independently of these inequities is aware of its responsibilities with regard to global warming and its consequences for India. On this issue, India faces a multifold challenge to its national interests and its international role. The crux is to find the right balance between national interest and international responsibility.
As in the past, the developed countries seek to push for a solution that is weighted in their favour. They have stronger economies, more financial resources, smaller populations and more advanced technology. Their ability to transition to a green economy is much easier, without compromising their high consumption lifestyles. Over time they have succeeded in shifting the primary burden of responsibility away from themselves to the developing countries increasingly.
The per capita contribution to greenhouse gases (GHG) by countries, which places India in a very favourable position, is no longer a yardstick for measuring responsibility. This is highly invidious for India. If India were 28 separate states, the GHG emissions from the subcontinent would not fall in the category of “big emitters”. India’s size works against it. It is projected today as the third largest emitter of CO2 when its emissions (2.2 giga tonnes) are far below those of China (9.3GT) and the US (4.8GT). On a per capita basis India’s emissions amount to 1.58 tonnes compared US’s 15.5 tonnes, Canada’s 15.32 , Australia’s 15.83, UK’s 5.99, South Korea’s 11.58 and China’s 6.9, Russia’s 10.19, Germany’s 8.93 and Japan’s 8.99 tonnes.

The issue of historical responsibility of industrialised countries for emissions, which is central to the notion of climate justice espoused by India, has been deflected by stressing the shared responsibility today of all countries faced with the catastrophic consequences of climate change, especially the developing ones, considered the most vulnerable.
The principle of  Common but Differentiated Responsibility and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) within the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that takes into account the social and economic conditions of individual countries has been steadily eroded in previous COPs, with the Paris Agreement departing from the distinction between industrialised and developing countries by subtly differentiating between subsets of developing countries, such as Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States.

Even as pressure on countries like India has mounted, the developed countries have not lived up to their own binding commitments, as for example, under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and the 2012 Doha Amendment to that Protocol. Canada and the US withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, while Japan, amongst others, did not take new second round commitments.
The Copenhagen Accord (COP15) of 2009 set a goal of raising $100 billion per yea r of new and additional financial by 2020 to help developing countries cut carbon emissions (mitigation), along with a new multilateral funding for adaptation. Article 9 of the Paris Agreement endorsed the $100 billion target. Available figures show the UK’s additional finance since 2009 is only $6.1 billion, while that of the US fell by $2.4 billion over the 2009-2018 period. The current target is valid till 2025 after which a new collective target will be fixed from “a floor of USD 100 billion per year.”
Nearly 80 per cent of climate finance to developing countries has taken the form of loans and not grants. In total, rich countries, according to available information, gave just $12.5 billion in the form of grants, $22 billion in loans with better-than-market rates and around $24 billion in loans with standard market rates. Some climate finance experts are concerned that a significant amount of budgeted development assistance has been re-labeled as climate finance. The COVID-19 pandemic has also complicated international climate change cooperation by placing enormous pressure on public budgets.
India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been pro-active internally and externally on the climate change front. Rather than India being seen as obstructive, the PM wants to participate in international discussions constructively as a climate change champion, though not at the cost of India’s legitimate interests and compromising its future.
Internally, much of India’s efforts in reducing emissions have come as a result of increased energy efficiency under various programmes. India’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of increasing the share of non-fossil fuels in its energy profile looks to be on track. In installed capacity of electricity generation, it has already reached 38 per cent against the NDC target of 40 per cent by 2030. India has also announced a target of achieving 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022, which was subsequently enhanced to 450 GW by 2030. Solar power in India is already amongst the cheapest in the world. Tapping into India’s vast solar and wind potential will help replace reliance on coal. India plans to focus on developing hydrogen power.
India’s external partnerships in the climate domain give it credibility to press its case for climate justice and availability of finance and technologies to achieve its declared targets. India is taking leadership in forging global coalitions to boost solar energy through the International Solar Alliance (ISA) launched with France and ramp up adaptation and resilience through the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI).
In the joint statement issued on the occasion of PM Modi’s visit to the US in September 2021, President Biden expressed support for PM Modi’s intention to achieve a domestic goal of installing 450 GW of renewable power by 2030 and acknowledged the importance of mobilising finance for investments in renewables, storage, and grid infrastructure, which will be done under the US-India Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership. During Danish PM’s visit to India in October two agreements on research in climate change were signed.
Developed Nations Have to Walk the Talk
India is under pressure to set a date for net zero emissions, as many countries have done, including China (2060). It is being argued that global carbon neutrality by 2050 is the only way to achieve the Paris Agreement target of keeping the planet’s temperature from rising beyond 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels. Theoretically, a country can become carbon-neutral at its current level of emissions, or even by increasing its emissions, if it is able to absorb or remove more. This suits the developed countries because now the burden is shared by everyone, and not only by them.
India is unlikely to announce a target date. It has kept its options open, as can be seen from the joint statement issued after the Quad summit in Washington in September 2021 which talks of achieving global net-zero emissions preferably by 2050, with the caveat “taking into account national circumstances”. India has to assess the feasibility of achieving such a target when its development priorities are yet to be met. The principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities have to guide India’s decision.
The developed countries have already appropriated most of the carbon space available to be able to restrict the rise of global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius. It would be equitable if they reached net zero by 2035 or even net negative zero before 2050—most unlikely—in order to leave much-needed carbon space for countries like India to grow.

India’s position is unique. Over the next two to three decades, India’s emissions are likely to grow at a fast pace, as it seeks growth to pull hundreds of millions out of poverty. Afforestation is not a solution to neutralise increased emissions. Most of the carbon removal technologies today are either unreliable or very expensive.
The net-zero goal, besides, does not figure in the 2015 Paris Agreement. India’s view is  that instead of opening up a parallel discussion on net-zero targets outside of the Paris Agreement framework, countries should deliver on what they have already promised. The developed nations have never delivered on their past promises and commitments. No major country achieved the emission-cut targets assigned to it under the Kyoto Protocol. The track record on their commitment to provide money and technology to developing countries to help them deal with the impacts of climate change has been poor.
India fears that the 2050 carbon-neutrality promise might meet a similar fate, although some countries are now binding themselves in law. It believes that the developed countries should, instead, take more ambitious climate actions now, to compensate for the unfulfilled earlier promises. India is the only G-20 country whose climate actions are compliant to the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global temperatures from rising beyond 2°C.
Some of India’s positions, views and concerns seem to have been incorporated in the G20 Rome Declaration, such as CBDR-RC, critical enablers for galvanising global climate action which includes commensurate, long-term, concessional climate finance, access to affordable and sustainable technology, and commitment to adopt sustainable lifestyles, responsible consumption and production patterns and importance of meeting SDG-12 targets, especially by the developed countries.
The absence of China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin at this week’s COP26 summit indicates how a global agenda is being affected by rising tensions between them and the West. Normally such conferences provide an occasion for heads of countries to have forward-looking bilateral dialogues, but that spirit of dialogue is absent today in ties between the West and China and Russia respectively.

https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-cop26-climate-change-summit.html,What Is COP26?,"And Other Questions About the Big U.N. Climate Summit . It was a milestone and set the stage for the Kyoto Protocol two years later,.",1 month ago,"The conference ran for two weeks and officially ended Nov. 12.
Where is COP26?
The meetings are being held at the Scottish Event Campus, Glasgow’s largest exhibition center. In addition to more than 21,000 attendees at formal talks and side events, large marches are expected around the city. Saturday, Nov. 6 was designated the Global Day for Climate Justice. More than 100,000 people marched in Glasgow , according to rally organizers, as world leaders debated how to deliver on the unmet promises of years past.
What is COP26?
COP stands for Conference of the Parties. In diplomatic parlance, the parties refer to 197 nations that agreed to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at a meeting in 1992. That year, the United States and some other countries ratified the treaty to combat “dangerous human interference with the climate system” and stabilize levels of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere.
This is the 26th time countries have gathered under the convention — hence, COP26 .

Who is attending COP26?
President Biden arrived the first Monday of the conference. He is among about 130 heads of state and government who attended, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain and Nicola Ferguson Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland. Presidents Xi Jinping of China, Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia did attend .
Thousands of diplomats from nearly 200 countries conducted the nuts and bolts of the negotiations throughout the two weeks, while business leaders, academic experts and activists, including Ms. Thunberg , monitored the proceedings and in many cases pushed for more ambitious targets.
What is the 1.5 degrees Celsius target?
The British and United Nations hosts have said they want to “ keep hope alive ” of constraining global temperature rise to under 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, compared with levels before the Industrial Revolution. That’s the threshold beyond which scientists say the dangers of global warming — such as deadly heat waves, water shortages, crop failures and ecosystem collapse — grow immensely.
Meeting that goal means all countries must commit to cutting emissions faster and deeper than they already are doing. There is also an expectation that wealthy countries will significantly increase financial support to help the most vulnerable nations adapt to the impacts of warming and build economies that don’t depend on fossil fuels.
What is net zero?
Scientists have warned that global warming will keep getting worse until humanity reaches “net zero” emissions globally — that is, the point at which we are no longer pumping any additional greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
So in recent years a growing number of countries and businesses have been pledging to “go net zero” by various dates. But the concept can easily be abused.
It’s one example of climate terminology that can be hard to decipher. We explained it and 12 others.
What happened after the first COP?
The first COP was held in Berlin in 1995, after a critical mass of nations ratified the climate convention. It was a milestone and set the stage for the Kyoto Protocol two years later, which required wealthy, industrialized nations to curb emissions.
That accord had its problems. Among them, the United States under former President George W. Bush rejected it, citing the fact that it did not require China, India and other major emerging economies to reduce their greenhouse gases.

What is the Paris Agreement?
In 2015, after more than two decades of disputes over which nations bear the most responsibility for tackling climate change, leaders of nearly 200 countries signed the Paris Agreement . That deal was considered groundbreaking. For the first time, rich and poor countries agreed to act, albeit at different paces, to tackle climate change.
The United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement under former President Donald J. Trump but rejoined in February of this year. On Monday, in a smaller session with world leaders after his address to the full conference, Mr. Biden referred to Mr. Trump’s action.
Understand the Lastest News on Climate Change
Card 1 of 5
Tighter auto pollution rules. The Environmental Protection Agency announced on Dec. 20 strengthened limits on pollution from automobile tailpipes , in a bid to reduce a major source of the carbon dioxide emissions that are heating the planet.
A week of wild weather. Violent storms  swept across the central and southern United States in mid-December, killing dozens  and leaving a trail of destruction. One key question is what role global warming might have played  in fueling such extreme weather events.
Sounding the alarm. A report on the state of the Arctic highlights troubling and consistent trends  in the region that are linked to global warming. Researchers are also growing increasingly concerned about Antarctica , where ice shelves are melting and wilder winds are altering crucial currents.
Google and climate denial. Google announced in October that it would stop placing ads on sites that deny the scientific consensus on climate change. But a new analysis shows that Google’s policy, which was to go into effect on Nov. 9, has had limited effect so far .
The race for green energy. Bolivia’s lithium deposits could one day power tens of millions of electric vehicles. One small Texas energy start-up set out to compete with Chinese and Russian industrial giants  in unlocking the country’s mineral riches.
“I guess I shouldn’t apologize, but I do apologize for the fact the United States, in the last administration, pulled out of the Paris Accords and put us sort of behind the eight ball,” he said.
While leaders made big promises in Paris, countries have not done enough to stave off the worst impacts of climate change, which brings us to COP26 in Glasgow, where the pressure is on for leaders to be more ambitious.
What is at stake at COP26?
For every fraction of a degree of warming , scientists say, the world will see more intense heat waves and drought, and more deadly floods and wildfires. Humans have already heated the planet by roughly 1.1 degrees Celsius, or 2 degrees Fahrenheit, since the 19th century.
Countries have less than 10 years to reduce emissions enough to keep the planet below 1.5 degrees of warming. So if leaders don’t commit to bold steps now, when so much global attention is focused on Glasgow, many fear the world will barrel toward dangerous levels of warming.
President Biden has said that America will cut emissions 50 to 52 percent below 2005 levels in the next decade. As of now, though, few policies are in place to make that happen. The European Union also made new promises to cut their emissions roughly 50 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. But China, now the world’s largest climate polluter, has not shifted its plan to peak emissions “before” 2030 — a target scientists say is not adequate to keep the planet on a 1.5 degree pathway.
Whether more countries come on board, and whether the United States can actually make good on its promise , will determine the trajectory of the planet.
What Covid safety measures are being taken at COP26?
The annual summit was delayed last year because of the pandemic. Despite calls from environmental organizations to delay again, organizers committed to holding this year’s event in person. The British hosts offered to help any delegates who need a Covid-19 vaccination obtain one, but they are not mandating that attendees be vaccinated.
Anyone entering the main conference site, known as the Blue Zone, must self-administer a rapid Covid-19 test and show a negative result.
Explaining COP26 to children
The science of climate change is complicated, and thinking about its consequences and how to fix the problem can be overwhelming. Explaining the factors in play to children can be especially difficult. To help start the conversation, The New York Times put together a climate change guide for children as part of this year’s Earth Day package.

This article is part of the Forum COP26 Live
We are entering the Anthropocene era with an outdated international governance framework.
A new phase of global law is needed that includes the institutions and mechanisms for achieving a sustainable world system.
The new global sustainability framework would be broken down into six key segments.
Our civilization is entering an era of seismic changes, challenges and opportunities. Many call it the Anthropocene , an unofficial unit of geologic time, used to describe the most recent period in Earth’s history when human activity started to have a significant impact on the planet’s climate and ecosystems. The driver of these changes is a new phase of globalization and technological progress with a tremendous impact on our ecosystem. Global processes affect different spheres of life in different ways, but the current fragile world order is threatened by the imbalances they are introducing – as shown in a range of rising threats across the planet.
The third era of international law
It is unlikely that we will be able to govern in the era of the Anthropocene through old norms and institutions. International law has already gone through two main stages: international law as the law of interstate relations and then as the law of international relations (regulated or mediated by supranational institutions, or nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). As we work out how to face the challenges of coming decades at COP26, now is the time for international law to enter a third phase: global law, truly governing sustainable development as a world community and providing solutions to planetary-level challenges.
Have you read?
What will the Paris Agreement mean for global governance?
Regarding sustainable development, the Montreal Protocol of 1987 laid the foundation for climate diplomacy, while the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change of 1992 (UNFCCC) set guiding principles for the Conference of the Parties (COP) forum. More recently, the Kyoto Protocol of 2005 dealt with the reduction of emissions among developed countries, before the Paris Agreement of 2015 , which outlined the consequences of climate change as a universal human problem and the need to set emission targets for all countries. But now the international legal framework has become stuck, with countries setting their own goals without transparent accountability mechanisms.
What is global law?
Global law – as defined by the Global Law Forum – is a system of principles, norms and technological solutions aimed at the formation of global governance for sustainable development and the realization of global human rights ( including digital rights ). Global law is not a parallel third system of law (to domestic and international legislation); it aims to take into account all current subjects of international law, based on international laws, as well as the domestic legal systems of all countries.
The principles of global law are based on the interdependence of our social planetary ecosystem and include:
The realization of human rights
Giving priority to solving global threats through the creation of global governance
Unification of legal norms and the creation of digital mechanisms for their implementation (with the development of govtech, civtech and legaltech)
Open, transparent, decentralized global law-making with a multistakeholder element
Making sustainability a global reality
The classic concept of sustainable development combines three different components: environmental, social and economic, all reflected in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 . UN Secretary-General António Guterres has stated that: “The global community is at a critical moment in its pursuit of the sustainable development goals (SDGs).""
But despite this realization, the modern global sustainable development framework is failing to prepare institutions to respond to current threats – otherwise, the COP26 meeting currently underway in Glasgow, Scotland , would not be so fraught with argument about whether we can keep to a 1.5°C temperature rise. A new phase of sustainability, underpinned by reinforced global law, is required.
Therefore, we propose a move to a global sustainability framework, which includes the balanced development of global processes in six key segments: legal, managerial, educational, environmental, social and economic. This presupposes building sustainable development not only from the perspective of setting goals but also including the tools for achieving them from the outset. This means the development of global sustainable development norms should be followed by management institutions for their implementation; ones that harness the technology of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and in parallel, a system of global education that will teach a generation of lawyers, internationalists and politicians to be guided by common human interests, not just national ones.
It is important that the modernization of the law will establish responsibility for climate and other threats in the form of specific obligations for states and transnational companies, create a unified information system for tracking global threats and form responses to them, and oblige countries to include global goals in their strategic documents. In addition, we will be able to revise many areas of global concern: disarmament, human rights (including digital rights) , tax and economic systems, health systems and others. Sustainability must be a key component of all our future global strategies and achieved not through self-regulation by companies, but through global legal obligations.
What’s the World Economic Forum doing about climate change?
Climate change poses an urgent threat demanding decisive action. Communities around the world are already experiencing increased climate impacts, from droughts to floods to rising seas. The World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report continues to rank these environmental threats at the top of the list.
To limit global temperature rise to well below 2°C and as close as possible to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, it is essential that businesses, policy-makers, and civil society advance comprehensive near- and long-term climate actions in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.
Global warming can be beaten thanks to this simple plan
The World Economic Forum's Climate Initiative supports the scaling and acceleration of global climate action through public and private-sector collaboration. The Initiative works across several workstreams to develop and implement inclusive and ambitious solutions.
This includes the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, a global network of business leaders from various industries developing cost-effective solutions to transitioning to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy. CEOs use their position and influence with policy-makers and corporate partners to accelerate the transition and realize the economic benefits of delivering a safer climate.
Mission Possible Platform: Delivering industry pathways t...
Show
One thing is clear. Companies, institutions, governments that do not include sustainability components in their future planning are a bit like stars whose light still reaches us, but that have been long since extinguished. Our civilization can respond to the current crisis and subsequent ones – but for this we must completely reformat our view of global legal regulation and governance in order to achieve greater harmony in development.

By Isabelle Gerretsen
A decade after it was first called for, Spain has finally approved its climate law. 
Spain’s parliament voted in favour of the long-awaited climate law , which commits the country to cut emissions 23% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. 
The law bans all new coal, gas and oil exploration and production permits with immediate effect, prohibits the sale of fossil fuel vehicles by 2040 and enshrines a goal to generate 74% of the country’s electricity with renewable sources by 2030.
Lawmakers agreed that production of fossil fuels must end on Spanish territory by 31 December 2042 and restricted the use of fossil fuel subsidies by mandating that they be “duly justified by social, economic or social interest”.
“For the planet, for our future and for the next generations. From today, Spain has a climate law on which to build a green, sustainable, fair and prosperous future for all,” prime minister Pedro Sanchez tweeted following the vote on Thursday. 
Spain’s energy and environment minister Teresa Ribera described the legislation as “an essential law we must continue to build on”. In an interview with Spanish newspaper El Pais , Ribera acknowledged it “should have been put in place 10 years ago”.
Women and youth are leading Kenya’s coral reef revival
Spain’s 2030 emission reduction target is significantly lower than goals set by other major European emitters. Germany announced last week it would cut emissions 65% between 1990 and 2030 and the UK committed to 68% cuts during the same period. The EU finalised discussions to raise the bloc’s 2030 target from 40% to at least 55% last month. 
But unlike the UK and Germany, Spain’s emissions rose between 1990 and 2007 , and are currently at levels seen in the late 1990s. Spain failed to meet its targets under the Kyoto Protocol, exceeding its emissions cap.
This is one argument the Spanish government uses to justify its lower target for 2030. When compared with a 2020 baseline, the new target is among the most ambitious in Europe.
“The argument is if you take present-day emissions as your baseline and look forward, then Spain is in line with that EU commitment and is among the highest,” David Howell, head of environmental governance at NGO SEO Birdlife, told Climate Home News.
But when compared against a 1990 baseline, the targets are far less ambitious. “Spain has only just dropped down below 1990 levels,” Howell said.

Howell said Spain would have to make a “huge effort” to catch up with other EU nations that have been on a decarbonisation pathway for a long time. “We think 55% is what Spain should be setting out to achieve as an industrialised nation with historic responsibility,” he said.
The law states that climate goals should be reviewed periodically, with the first consultation scheduled for 2023. Campaigners hope the government will choose to raise its ambition then. 
“Only by increasing its emission reduction targets will Spain be able to decisively combat the climate emergency,” Greenpeace said in a statement.
Campaigners have called on the government to establish an independent climate committee that would advise on enhancing Spain’s climate goal from 2023. 
“I do regret that the Spanish climate law doesn’t have an independent science expert committee, nor carbon budgets like the UK does,” said Peter Sweatman, CEO of consultancy climate strategy and partners in Madrid.
Despite these omissions, the law “is a step in the right direction,” Sweatman told Climate Home News.
The law is the first in the world requiring all companies to set out clear climate action plans with emissions reduction targets that must be achieved over a period of five years. “This is a win for leading firms, and Spanish listed businesses in reducing climate risks,” said Sweatman.
For Romain Ioualalen, senior campaigner at Oil Change International, the decision to end fossil fuel production in less than 12 years is “a welcome development”.
“It is further proof that the escalating climate crisis means that no country can claim to be a climate leader if they don’t put an end to fossil fuel expansion and commit to phasing out production,” he said.

The human right to a clean and healthy environment: 6 things you need to know
15 October 2021
Climate and Environment
On 8 October, loud and unusual applause reverberated around the chamber of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. A battle fought for decades by environmental activists and rights’ defenders, had finally borne fruit.
For the first time ever, the United Nations body whose mission is to promote and protect human rights around the world, passed a resolution recognising access to a healthy and sustainable environment as a universal right.
The text also calls on countries to work together, and with other partners, to implement this breakthrough.
“Professionally that was probably the most thrilling experience that I ever have had or that I ever will have. It was a massive team victory. It took literally millions of people, and years and years of work to achieve this resolution”, said David Boyd, UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Environment, who was in the room when President Nazhat Shameem from Fiji, brought down her gavel, announcing the voting results.
43 votes in favour and 4 abstentions counted as a unanimous victory to pass the text that cites the efforts of at least 1,100 civil society, child, youth and indigenous people’s organizations, who have been campaigning for global recognition, implementation and protection of the human right to a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment.  
A little bit of joyful emotion at the very staid Human Rights Council, as the UN for the first time recognizes the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment! (Mask was only off for a moment!) pic.twitter.com/8rUXJpz9z0
But why is this recognition important, and what does it mean for climate change-affected communities?
Here are six key things you need to know, compiled by us here at UN News.
1. First, let’s recall what the Human Rights Council does, and what its resolutions mean
The Human Rights Council is an inter-governmental body within the United Nations system, responsible for strengthening the promotion and protection of human rights around the globe and for addressing situations of human rights violations and make recommendations on them.
The Council is made up of 47 UN Member States which are elected by the absolute majority in the General Assembly and represent every region of the world.
Human Rights Council resolutions are “political expressions” that represent the position of the Council’s members (or the majority of them) on particular issues and situations. These documents are drafted and negotiated among States with to advance specific human rights issues.
They usually provoke a debate among States, civil society and intergovernmental organisations; establish new ‘standards’, lines or principles of conduct; or reflect existing rules of conduct.
Resolutions are drafted by a “core group”: Costa Rica, the Maldives, Morocco, Slovenia and Switzerland, were the countries who brought resolution 48/13 for its adoption in the council, recognising for the first time that having a clean, healthy and sustainable environment is indeed a human right.
2. It was a resolution decades in the making
In 1972, the United Nations Conference on the Environment in Stockholm , which ended with a historical declaration, was the first one to place environmental issues at the forefront of international concerns and marked the start of a dialogue between industrialized and developing countries on the link between economic growth, the pollution of the air, water and the ocean, and the well-being of people around the world.
UN Member States back then, declared that people have a fundamental right to ""an environment of a quality that permits a life of dignity and well-being,"" calling for concrete action. They called for both the Human Rights Council and the UN General Assembly to act.
Since 2008, the Maldives, a Small Island Developing State on the frontline of climate change impacts, has been tabling a series of resolutions on human rights and climate change, and in the last decade, on human rights and environment.
In the last few years, the work of the Maldives and its allied States, as well as the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Environment and different NGOs, have been moving the international community towards the declaration of a new universal right.
Support for UN recognition of this right grew during the COVID-19 pandemic. The idea was endorsed by UN's Secretary-General António Guterres and High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, as well as more than 1,100 civil society organisations from around the world. Nearly 70 states on the Human Rights Council also added their voices to a call by the council’s core group on human rights and environment for such action, and 15 UN agencies also sent a rare joint declaration advocating for it.
“A surge in emerging zoonotic diseases, the climate emergency, pervasive toxic pollution and a dramatic loss of biodiversity have brought the future of the planet to the top of the international agenda”, a group of UN experts said in a statement released in June this year, on World Environment Day.

3. It was a David vs Goliath story…
To finally reach the vote and decision, the core group lead intensive inter-governmental negotiations, discussions and even experts’ seminars, over the past few years.
Levy Muwana, a Youth Advocate and environmentalist from Zambia, participated in one of the seminars.
“As a young child, I was affected with bilharzia, a parasitic disease, because I was playing in the dirty water near my household.
A few years later, a girl died in my community from cholera. These events are sadly common and occurring more often.
Water-born infectious diseases are increasing worldwide, especially across sub-Saharan Africa, due to the changing climate”, he told Council members last August.
Muwana made clear that his story was not unique, as millions of children worldwide are significantly impacted by the devastating consequences of the environmental crisis. “1.7 million of them die every year from inhaling contaminated air or drinking polluted water”, he said.
The activist, along with over 100.000 children and allies had signed a petition for the right to a healthy environment to be recognised, and they were finally heard.
“There are people who want to continue the process of exploiting the natural world and have no reservations about harming people to do that. So those very powerful opponents have kept this room from going forward for decades.
It's almost like a David and Goliath story that all of these civil society organizations were able to overcome this powerful opposition, and now we have this new tool that we can use to fight for a more just and sustainable world”, says David Boyd, the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Environment.

4. But what good is a non-legally binding resolution?
Mr. Boyd explains that the resolution should be a catalyst for more ambitious action on every single environmental issue that we face.
“It really is historic, and it really is meaningful for everyone because we know right now that 90% of people in the world are breathing polluted air.
“So right off the bat if we can use this resolution as a catalyst for actions to clean up air quality, then we're going to be improving the lives of billions of people”, he emphasizes.
Human Rights Council resolutions might not be legally binding, but they do contain strong political commitments.
“The best example we have of what kind of a difference these UN resolutions make is if we look back at the resolutions in 2010 that for the first time recognized the right to water . That was a catalyst for governments all over the world who added the right to water to their constitutions, their highest and strongest laws”, Mr. Boyd says.
The Rapporteur cites Mexico, which after adding the right to water in the constitution, has now extended safe drinking water to over 1,000 rural communities.
“There are a billion people who can't just turn on the tap and have clean, safe water coming out, and so you know, for a thousand communities in rural Mexico, that's an absolutely life-changing improvement. Similarly, Slovenia, after they put the right to water in their constitution because of the UN resolutions, they then took action to bring safe drinking water to Roma communities living in informal settlements on city outskirts”.
According to the UN Environment Programme ( UNEP ), the recognition of the right to a healthy environment at the global level will support efforts to address environmental crises in a more coordinated, effective and non-discriminatory manner, help achieve the Sustainable Developing Goals, provide stronger protection of rights and of the people defending the environment, and help create a world where people can live in harmony with nature.

Extreme weather events are devastating many countries, including Fiji which was hit by a cyclone in 2016.
5. The link between human rights and environment is indisputable
Mr. Boyd has witnessed firsthand the devastating impact that climate change has already had on people’s rights.
In his first country mission as a Special Rapporteur, he met the first community in the world that had to be completely relocated due to rising sea levels, coastal erosion and increased intensity of storm surges.
“You know, from this beautiful waterfront paradise on a Fijian island, they had to move their whole village inland about three kilometers. Older persons, people with disabilities, pregnant women, they're now separated from the ocean that has sustained their culture and their livelihoods for many generations”.
These situations are not only seen in developing countries. Mr. Boyd also visited Norway where he met Sami indigenous people also facing the impacts of climate change.
“I heard really sad stories there. For thousands of years their culture and their economy has been based on reindeer herding, but now because of warm weather in the winters, even in Norway, north of the Arctic Circle, sometimes it rains.
“The reindeer who literally for thousands of years had been able to scrape away snow during the winter to get to the lichens and mosses that sustained them, now can't scrape away the ice - and they’re starving”.
The story repeats itself in Kenya, where pastoralists are losing their livestock because of droughts that are being exacerbated by climate change.
“They have done nothing to cause this global crisis and they’re the ones who are suffering, and that's why it's such a human rights issue.
“That's why it's such an issue of justice. Wealthy countries and wealthy people need to start to pay for the pollution they've created so that we can help these vulnerable communities and these vulnerable peoples to adapt and to rebuild their lives”, Mr. Boyd said.

Air pollution in Dhaka, Bangladesh, is leading to a series of health problems for the city's inhabitants.
6. What’s next?
The Council resolution includes an invitation to the UN General Assembly to also consider the matter. The Special Rapporteur says he is “cautiously optimistic” that the body will pass a similar resolution within the next year.
“We need this. We need governments and we need everyone to move with a sense of urgency. I mean, we're living in a climate, biodiversity, and pollution crisis, and also a crisis of these emerging diseases like COVID which have environmental root causes. And so that's why this resolution is critically important because it says to every government in the world ‘you have to put human rights at the centre of climate action, of conservation, of addressing pollution and of preventing future pandemics’”.
For Dr. Maria Neira, the World Health Organization’s ( WHO ) environment chief, the resolution is already having important repercussions and a mobilizing impact.
“The next step will be how we translate that on the right to clean air and whether we can push, for instance, for the recognition of WHO’S Global Air Quality Guidelines and the levels of exposure to certain pollutants at a country level. It will also help us to move certain legislation and standards at the national level”, she explains.
Air pollution, primarily the result of burning fossil fuels, which also drives climate change, causes 13 deaths per minute worldwide. Dr. Neira calls for the end of this “absurd fight” against the ecosystems and environment.
“All the investments need to be on ensuring access to safe water and sanitation, on making sure that electrification is done with renewable energy and that our food systems are sustainable.”
According to WHO, achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement would save millions of lives every year due to improvements in air quality, diet, and physical activity, among other benefits.
“The climate emergency has become a matter of survival for many populations. Only systemic, profound and rapid changes will make it possible to respond to this global ecological crisis"", says the Special Rapporteur.
For Mr. Boyd, the approval of the historical resolution in the Human Rights Council was a ‘paradoxical’ moment.
“There was this incredible sense of accomplishment and also at the exact same time a sense of how much work remains to be done to take these beautiful words and translate them into changes that will make people's lives better and make our society more sustainable”.
The newly declared right to a healthy and clean environment will also hopefully influence positively negotiations during the upcoming UN Climate Conference COP26, in Glasgow, which has been described by the UN chief as the last chance to ‘turn the tide’ and end the war on our planet.

A New Study Provides Guidelines · Innovative peatland restoration efforts key to mitigating climate . › · How peat.,21-Oct-2021,"Oct. 21, 2021 10:45AM EST Science
Peatlands in the Bogong High Plains, Victoria, Australia. Joslin Moore
Peatlands are unique wetland ecosystems that also provide an important sink for carbon dioxide . Unfortunately, they are under threat from human activity, and from the climate crisis itself.
Now, new research published in Biological Conservation uses a novel approach to guide conservationists in restoring these essential wetlands.
""Policymakers and practitioners need the best available information to be able to protect and restore peatlands,"" study lead author Dr. Jessica Rowland, a research fellow in biological sciences at Australia's Monash University, told EcoWatch in an email.
Why Peatlands Matter
Peatlands are a type of wetland that can be found in nearly every country on earth and cover around three percent of total land area, according to IUCN . They are formed when standing water slows the decomposition of plant matter, eventually creating peat.
Because this peat is formed of plants that have drawn carbon dioxide down from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, it is an incredibly important tool for fighting the climate crisis. In fact, peatlands are the world's largest land-based carbon sink, sequestering 550 gigatonnes of carbon, more than any other vegetation type including forests.
Peatlands do more than just store carbon, however.
""Peatlands provide many ecosystem services that people rely on, such as clean water, food and flood protection from storms,"" Rowland said.
They are also important for biodiversity , providing habitat for unique species like Sphagnum moss and the threatened Southern Corroboree frog. The 60 percent decline in the population of Borneo orangutans over the last sixty years has been linked to the destruction of their peat swamp habitat, according to IUCN.
As the case of the orangutans illustrates, peatlands are at risk from human activity.
""Many peatlands all around the world have been converted for agriculture or developments, and face mounting threats from drying out or fires due to climate change,"" Rowland said.
In Europe, for example, another recent study found that 20 percent of the continent's raised bogs are at risk from drainage or the climate crisis. In Australia, Rowland pointed out, the country's alpine peatlands face pressures from climate change, fire, trampling by deer and horses and invasive weeds.
All of this is bad news for the climate. Damaged peatlands contribute around 10 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions from land use, according to IUCN. Fires in Indonesian peat swamp forests in 2015 emitted more carbon dioxide each day than the entire U.S. economy.
Rapid Evidence Reviews
So what can be done to protect and restore these essential ecosystems? To answer that question, Rowland and her team conducted something called a ""rapid evidence review."" This is a method often used in the healthcare field to quickly communicate important scientific findings to policymakers, the study authors explained.
""Rapid evidence reviews are a new approach to rigorously and quickly synthesising information – unlike traditional systematic reviews, which can take years,"" Rowland told EcoWatch. ""Rapid reviews can do this by systematically searching the literature for reviews rather than primary studies. In our study, we captured information from 453 unique papers in the 23 reviews that we included.""
By using this method, the researchers determined that restoring peatlands in cooler climates means restoring three key features:
Hydrology
Chemical Properties
Key Species
This can be achieved through various methods including rewetting, shading, mowing, and controlling grazing animals like deer and replanting vegetation. Further, one conservation action can have many positive impacts.
""Many of these interventions were effective as restoring multiple features across the ecosystems – rewetting to increase the water table improved the hydrological conditions, but also improved the chemistry and cover of key plant species,"" Rowland said.
However, conservationists need to be aware of the state of a given peatland before they plan an intervention.
""Replanting key peatland species is unlikely to be helpful if the peatland has dried out, as the water-loving plants likely won't survive,"" Rowland explained.
While taking actions like restoring water levels and vegetation is important, it is equally important to protect peatlands from being degraded in the first place, such as preventing trampling from grazing animals or stopping the soil from drying out.
Rowland and her Monash University team hope their findings will be applied in Australia. To that end, they have prepared fact sheets to share with policy makers, land managers and other researchers. Next, they want to use the rapid evidence review method to determine conservation best-practices for other ecosystems.
""We are also applying the rapid evidence review approach to the conservation of Australian woodland ecosystems and we aim to develop a guide to help others apply the method to their own systems,"" Rowland said.
They also plan to do more work on peatland conservation by speaking to land managers and researchers about insights and experiences that may not have made it into peer-reviewed papers.
""Our team is working on a project that brings together land managers, researchers and policymakers to identify the key research questions that need to be answered to enhance the conservation of Australian alpine and subalpine peatlands,"" Rowland said.

Key Moments From Day 1 of the COP26 Climate Change Summit
Meeting in Glasgow, President Biden and a host of other world leaders sounded dire warnings, but hopes for breakthrough action are muted.

‘Digging our own graves’: With the planet in peril, leaders appeal for urgent action.

With humanity already struggling to cope with rising seas, more powerful storms, deadly heat waves and rapidly changing ecosystems needed to sustain life, the global climate summit in Glasgow opened on Monday with a series of desperate pleas for action from nations large and small.
“Climate change is already ravaging the world,” President Biden said in a speech at the summit, known as COP26, on Monday afternoon. But even while global warming is causing widespread economic damage and upending lives, he said, this was also a moment of opportunity to reshape the way humans live in better harmony with nature.
“We are standing at an inflection point in world history,” he said, calling climate change an “existential threat to human existence as we know it.”
That point was echoed by Prime Minister Mia Mottley of Barbados. “If our existence is to mean anything we must act,” she said.
Underscoring the urgency of the moment, with leaders of more than 120 countries gathered for the summit, the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said that the effects of a warming planet were being felt “from the ocean depths to the mountaintops.”
“Sea level rise has doubled from 30 years ago,” he said. Oceans are hotter than ever, parts of the Amazon rain forest emit more carbon than they absorb, and in the last decade about four billion people were affected by events related to the changing climate.
“Enough of burning and drilling and mining our way deeper,” Mr. Guterres said. “We are digging our own graves.”
The aim of the summit is for countries to nudge each other to strengthen their own climate plans so that the worst effects of climate change can be averted. In order to do that, according to scientific consensus, the average global temperature rise should be limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of this century, compared with levels before the Industrial Revolution. That is the threshold beyond which scientists say the dangers of global warming — such as deadly heat waves, water shortages, crop failures and ecosystem collapse — grow immensely.”
Mr. Guterres called on countries to return to the summit every year to nudge one another “until keeping to 1.5 degrees is assured, until subsidies to fossil fuels end, until there is a price on carbon and until coal is phased out.”
Many countries will press against such specific measures, and the absence of leaders from Russia and China from the meeting cast doubts on how united the world can be in the struggle.
China, the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, proposed a new emissions target that is largely indistinguishable from one it made six years ago. The United States, the largest historic emitter, has an ambitious emissions goal but has not been able to pass legislation to achieve it. And Australia, India and Russia have not made any new pledges to draw down climate pollution this decade.
Meanwhile, only a few wealthy countries have allocated money to help poor and vulnerable nations cope with the effects of climate disasters that those countries have done little to cause.
Those two factors make the likelihood of success at the conference, known as COP26, uncertain.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain kicked off the summit with an urgent call for action, likening climate change to a bomb primed to explode, even as he acknowledged the challenges ahead.
“The tragedy is that this is not a movie and the doomsday device is real,” he said. “Humanity has long since run down the clock on climate change. It is one minute to midnight on that doomsday clock, and we need to act now.”
Ms. Mottley poked holes in the climate promises of some countries that are based on technologies that don’t yet exist.
“This is at best reckless,” she said, and “at worst dangerous.”

Biden Urges Global ‘Ambition’ and ‘Innovation’ to Fight Climate Change
At the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, President Biden warned that the world only has “a brief window” to combat the growing impacts of climate change and described the crisis as an opportunity to drive worldwide economic growth and job gains.
The science is clear. We only have a brief window left before us to raise our ambitions and to raise to meet the task that’s rapidly narrowing. This is the decisive decade in which we have an opportunity to prove ourselves. We can keep the goal of limiting global warming to just 1.5 degrees Celsius within our reach if we come together. If we commit to doing our part of each of our nations with determination and with ambition, that’s what COP26 is all about. Glasgow must be the kick off of a decade, a decade of ambition and innovation to preserve our shared future. Climate change is already ravaging the world. We’ve heard from many speakers. It’s not hypothetical. It’s not a hypothetical threat, it is destroying people’s lives and livelihoods, and doing it every single day. It’s costing our nations trillions of dollars. But ladies and gentlemen, within the growing catastrophe, I believe there’s an incredible opportunity not just for the United States, but for all of us. We’re standing at an inflection point in world history. We have the ability to invest in ourselves and build an equitable, clean energy future and in the process, create millions of good paying jobs and opportunities around the world.

President Biden told world leaders on Monday that “we only have a brief window before us to raise our ambitions” to fight climate change, warning that climate disasters were already imposing trillions of dollars of economic costs but offering hope that a shift to lower-emission energy sources could create millions of jobs around the world.
“Glasgow must be the kickoff of a decade of innovation and ambition to preserve our shared world,” Mr. Biden said in a speech that lasted just over 11 minutes, near the beginning of a session with fellow leaders at the U.N. summit on climate change, known as COP26 .
Badly undercut by domestic politics, Mr. Biden arrived in Glasgow with a weaker hand than he had hoped for. Opposition in Congress has forced him to abandon the most powerful mechanism in his climate agenda: a program that would have quickly cleaned up the electricity sector by rewarding power companies that migrated away from fossil fuels and penalizing those that did not.
His fallback strategy is a bill that would provide $555 billion in clean energy tax credits and incentives. It would be the largest amount ever spent by the United States to tackle global warming but would cut only about half as much pollution.
The president touted the potential emissions reductions in the bill, but even that pared-down measure has uncertain prospects to make it through Congress and to Mr. Biden’s desk. He hopes to pair it with new environmental regulations, although they have yet to be completed and could be undone by a future president.
In a smaller session with world leaders after his address to the full conference, Mr. Biden referred to his predecessor, Donald J. Trump, withdrawing the United States from the 2015 Paris climate accord, a policy he reversed upon taking office.
“I guess I shouldn’t apologize, but I do apologize for the fact the United States, in the last administration, pulled out of the Paris Accords and put us sort of behind the eight ball,” he said.
Mr. Biden did not lay out more ambitious short-term targets or pledges for American emissions reductions , beyond those he detailed at a climate meeting in April, although he said he would release on Monday a long-term plan to bring the United States to net-zero emissions by 2050 .
He also did not call out China — as his national security adviser did earlier in the day — for insufficient action on emissions reduction. Instead, he called in his speech for global cooperation.
“We’re still falling short,” he said. “There is no more time to hang back or sit on the fence or argue amongst ourselves. This is a challenge of our collective lifetime.”
Mr. Biden said that in the days to come, his administration would detail new efforts to reduce emissions through forestry and the agriculture and oil and gas industries. And he pledged additional U.S. support for developing nations in mitigating and adapting to climate change.
“God bless you all,” Mr. Biden said, slightly tweaking his traditional speech-closing remarks, “and may God save the planet.”

The Biden administration ramped up its criticism of China on Monday as the U.S. president traveled to Glasgow for the climate summit, calling on the Chinese to increase their emissions-cutting ambitions.
The critique sought to portray China and its leader, Xi Jinping — who is notably absent from COP26 — as large-economy laggards in the race to limit rising temperatures. It was also aimed at shifting criticism away from America’s domestic struggles in pushing to reduce emissions.
Briefing reporters on Air Force One, President Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, called the Chinese “significant outliers” among countries that have made commitments in an attempt to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. Mr. Sullivan said that China had “an obligation to step up to greater ambition as we go forward.”
Asked about how the tense U.S.-China relationship was affecting climate talks globally, Mr. Sullivan heaped blame on Beijing, calling the country’s climate steps “deeply asymmetrical.”
“The United States, despite whatever difficulties we have with China, is stepping up,” Mr. Sullivan said. “We’re going to do 50 to 52 percent reduction by 2030. We’re coming forward with all of our commitments — we’re filling our end of the bargain at COP.”
China is “a big country with a lot of resources and a lot of capabilities,” he added, “and they are perfectly well capable of living up to their responsibilities.”
Diplomats from some of the world’s most vulnerable countries have avoided openly criticizing China. When asked about the new target that Beijing announced last week, which is largely indistinguishable from its 2015 target of peaking emission before 2030, many diplomats said only that all Group of 20 nations must be more ambitious.
“The world needs more,” Tina Stege, a climate ambassador for the Marshall Islands, said in a statement. “China can do more, and it should, as should all members of the G20.”
Alf Wills, a former chief negotiator for South Africa, said that developing nations were loath to publicly criticize China for several reasons. For one, Chinese diplomats can be instrumental in pushing wealthy nations to deliver funding for poor countries. For another, China now far outpaces the United States in delivering aid to the developing world.
“To a large extent China represents, from an economic perspective, pretty much an economic superpower,” Mr. Wills said, “particularly among developing countries.”

India announced on Monday that it would significantly expand renewable energy sources in its total energy mix and called on the rich world to pony up $1 trillion to help developing countries make the energy transition.
The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi , also said his country would aim to be “ net-zero ” by 2070, but far more significant were the more immediate goals that he announced.
In his remarks to the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow , Mr. Modi said India would aim to build 500 gigawatts of renewable energy and ensure that half of its energy mix comes from sources other than fossil fuels by 2030. That means coal, which provides the bulk of India’s electricity, would remain a large part of its energy mix in the coming decade. India is one of the world’s largest consumers of coal.
India is among the few big economies that have not submitted an updated Nationally Determined Contribution, as the Paris Agreement stipulates.
Mr. Modi said nothing about when his country’s emissions would peak, let alone decline.
India, an emerging economy, has almost 1.4 billion people, a huge share of them young and working-age. It accounts for almost 18 percent of the world’s population but only 6 percent of global emissions currently, and a negligible share of the cumulative greenhouse gases emitted in the past that are already warming the atmosphere.
Mr. Modi said the carbon intensity of India’s economy, which refers to how much carbon dioxide emissions are produced relative to the country’s gross domestic product, would decline by 45 percent by 2030.
O.P. Agarwal, the head of the India office of World Resources Institute, a research and advocacy group, said focusing on the expansion of renewable energy by 2030 was “a strategic and achievable ambition.”
India has been under scrutiny for when it might announce a net-zero target. Mr. Modi said 2070, which is 10 years later than China’s promise and 20 years later than promises made by the United States and Europe.
India has been vocal in pressing for money from industrialized countries to help developing economies make the energy transition, and Mr. Modi upped the ante on Monday. “India expects developed countries to make $1 trillion in climate finance available as soon as possible,” he said.
A promised $100 billion in climate aid has not yet been delivered. According to a recent analysis by Carbon Brief, India is by far the largest recipient of climate finance.

TOKYO, Nov 9 (Reuters) - More than 20 countries agreed to phase out coal power at the U.N. climate talks in Glasgow, but not Japan - a ""leap backwards"" for a country that once led the way on the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The pact was among a raft of pledges made at the COP26 summit in the last week. Japan, the world's third-biggest importer of the dirtiest fossil fuel, declined to sign because it needed to preserve all its options for power generation, officials said.
Critics called that short-sighted, even as new the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has agreed to step up other environmental measures.

""Despite Prime Minister Kishida pledging to direct increased funding to climate finance, we are disappointed that he failed to address the elephant in the room - Japan's dependency on coal,"" said Eric Christian Pedersen, head of responsible investments at Danish fund manager Nordea Asset Management.
The criticism highlights the shift in Japan's circumstances.  It led climate change efforts during the 1990s Kyoto Protocol era, but has been burning more coal and other fossil fuels after the Fukushima disaster 10 years ago left many nuclear plants idle. read more

Not phasing out coal has ""positioned Japan to take a leap backwards by signalling thermal power plants can keep running based on new technologies that do not exist,"" said Kiran Aziz, head of responsible investments at KLP, Norway's largest pension fund.
China, the world's biggest source of climate change-fuelling gases, did not sign the pact and President Xi Jinping did not attend the conference. The country has said it would reduce its use of coal for electricity by 1.8 percent over the next five years.
Japan has pledged billions of dollars for vulnerable countries and to support building infrastructure in Asia for renewables and cleaner-burning fuels. It has also cut targets for coal use and raised those for renewables. read more
""In Japan, where resources are scarce and the country is surrounded by the sea, there is no single perfect energy source,"" Noboru Takemoto, an industry ministry deputy director, told Reuters. ""For this reason, Japan does not support the statement"" on coal.
The ministry said last year it would accelerate shutdowns of coal-fired plants by 2030, later setting minimum efficiency standards and requiring companies to submit annual updates on phase-outs.
But companies are resisting such plans, a senior executive at a major Japanese generator said.
""It is being delayed and dragged out because a lot of companies are saying these units still work and are cheaper,"" the executive said, adding that ""a leadership push is needed.""
A Reuters survey of Japanese companies operating old coal power units, including Hokuriku Electric Power (9505.T) and Hokkaido Electric Power (9509.T) , showed that most of them have not decided schedules to shut them down.
Hokuriku Electric plans to shut just one 250-megawatt coal unit in 2024, a spokesperson told Reuters,
""Our coal-fired thermal power plants play an important role,"" in maintaining stable electricity supplies, the spokesperson said.
Hokkaido Electric, which shut two coal units in 2019, has no closings planned, while the other five companies surveyed said they have no firm proposals. Some are looking at using cleaner fuels, such as ammonia, to burn with coal and other technologies to keep them operating more cleanly. read more
""For pro-coal corporate Japan, what's more important is business, not the planet,"" said Mutsuyoshi Nishimura, a former senior Japanese government official and chief climate change negotiator. ""It's sad to see there is no vision for a better, more sustainable and more competitive Japan.""

Members of the National party and farming groups have been claiming for months that landholders have done all the “heavy lifting” on cuts to climate pollution in Australia.
On Tuesday morning, the resources minister and Queensland MP, Keith Pitt, was the latest to make the claim.
“We know for example that under Kyoto we lost property rights in Australia through the states, and in Queensland that has been particularly damaging,” Pitt said.
Pitt is claiming that as a direct result of the Kyoto protocol – a UN climate deal that Australia signed in 1997 – landholders lost out.
04:24
Why Australia is accused of cheating during climate talks – video
Anyone across the history of the Kyoto deal – and Australia’s emissions from land clearing – knows there is no way this can be true.
The Nationals are in the midst of fractious negotiations with their Coalition partners the Liberals over climate policy, and have used this “heavy lifting” argument to justify potential exemptions and even retrospective payouts for farmers.
But Pitt’s argument is based on a revision of history that would require a global agreement on climate to have been signed at least seven years earlier than it actually was.

In 1990, government figures show emissions from land clearing were at about 193m tonnes – roughly a third of the country’s entire footprint. But by 1997, this was down to about 53m tonnes.
The first deal under the United Nations climate convention was not agreed until late 1997 in Kyoto, when Australia secured a deal that would allow its emissions to actually go up from 1990 to 2010.

That means all of those cuts to Australia’s emissions from 1990 to 1997, which the Nationals and others have claimed were down to “heavy lifting”, were in fact entirely inconsequential to any concerns over climate change.
And any restrictions on land clearing could not have been “under Kyoto”, as the resources minister has suggested, because Kyoto didn’t exist when the bulk of the emissions cuts were being made.
A review of state land-clearing laws and how they relate to Australia’s emissions found the first reforms that were effective in cutting the rates of land clearing were introduced in Queensland and New South Wales in 1995.
But those laws were about slowing down habitat loss and erosion and had nothing at all to do with climate change and nothing to do with federal government policy.
Dr Megan Evans, a conservation policy expert at UNSW Canberra, says there has been “heavy lifting” done by landholders on emissions, but this has come through the generation of carbon offsets through the government’s emissions reduction fund.
“The changes to land clearing regulations in Queensland and New South Wales predates Kyoto by several years. These laws were changed because it was recognised that too much land clearing is unsustainable and detrimental for soils and biodiversity.
“Unfortunately, the federal government retrospectively claimed credit for these resulting emissions reductions. It’s like if you did a Maths assignment in year 5, and someone used your work to claim credit for their English test in year 12.”
Climate contrarians
We are less than two weeks until the start of pivotal international climate talks in Glasgow, and the Morrison government looks as though it won’t revise its ageing 2030 target agreed under the Abbott government in 2015.
Abbott, of course, is a contrarian on climate science who thinks – against the findings of scientific academies around the globe – that natural factors like changes in the Earth’s tilt and the sun’s energy reaching the planet “are at least as important for climate change” as carbon dioxide, which he says is “actually essential for life.”
Arguments like these are “strawman”.
No expert anywhere, ever, has suggested that CO2 isn’t a vital component in the Earth’s atmosphere. The problem comes when you liberate trillions of tonnes of it by digging up fossil fuels and burning them. Water is vital to life too, but you can drown in it.
On Monday, the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull told the ABC the Coalition party room was “caught in this vice” of “climate denialists that basically don’t take global warming seriously”.
Turnbull named four Nationals – MP George Christensen, deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce , Pitt and senator Matt Canavan.
“None of them believe in global warming. None of them think it’s real,” he said.
On Tuesday, ABC host Fran Kelly asked Pitt: “Do you think climate change is real?”
Pitt responded: “The climate is changing. It’s always changed.”
No expert anywhere, ever, has suggested the climate hasn’t changed before. Pitt’s glib response is a classic of climate contrarianism.
The point is not that the climate has changed before, but that human activity – mainly through fossil fuel burning – is causing changes at unprecedented rates that will have grave consequences for economies and societies if not checked.
Let us stop and wonder at the spectacle of a Morrison government resources minister who, when asked if he thinks climate change is real, responds with ""the climate is always changing... it's always changed."" #COP26Glasgow

Climate Study Group
Last Wednesday in Melbourne’s Herald Sun, a group of climate science contrarians calling themselves the Climate Study Group ran a half-page advertisement on page 19.
This unincorporated group of non-experts on climate science has run several ads over the years, all making claims that CO2 is not dangerous, or that climate models or the world’s climate scientists are all wrong.
Last week’s ad was no different. But it also included this factoid: “In 2012 the Griffith School of Environment forecast that by 2020 there would be no snow. The 2021 season has in fact commenced with record snow.”

Did the Griffith School of Environment really say that?
In 2012, the Australian newspaper ran a story with the headline “Enjoy snow now … by 2020, it’ll be gone.”
But the text of the story and quotes from Griffith University’s Prof Catherine Pickering – based on a media release from Griffith University – didn’t match the headline. Not even close.
Pickering actually said that by 2020, the Australian Alps would “lose something like 60% of the snow cover.”
In an email, Pickering says her statements then were based on research carried out by the CSIRO a few years earlier.
She wrote: “Since that newspaper article, there is even more research indicating temperatures are already rising and reductions in snow cover have already started to occur.”
One study from 2018 summarised several other studies of trends across the Australian Alps showing snow depths and the amount of snow cover all falling in recent decades.
So what about that other claim that 2021 had seen record snow?
Pickering says her team has looked at conditions at Spencers Creek in Kosciuszko national park in New South Wales – a site used for observations and modelling of snow conditions.
While 2021 was better than 2020, “it still started more than a month later than the best year for total snow – 1960 – and was down over 1.5 m for maximum snow depth compared to 1981.”
